  </br>></br>Chenardhwaj,			the  governor   of Kashmir,   wanted to broadcast	to the entire world that the Neelkanth	had	appeared	in  his		capital	city.	Not  in  the		other		frontier	towns		like Takshashila,		Karachapa		or Lothal.  His  Srinagar!		But the bird courier had arrived almost immediately		from the  Meluhan	capital		Devagiri , the		abode			of the		gods . The orders were  crystal   clear.   The  news  of the  arrival  of the Neelkanth	had  to  be kept  secret	until the  emperor			himself  had  seen	Shiva.	Chenardhwaj	was  ordered	to send Shiva along with an escort to Devagiri. Most importantly, Shiva himself was  not to be  told about  the legend.	‘The  emperor	will advise	the  supposed		Neelkanth in an appropriate manner,’ were the exact words in the message.</br></br>Chenardhwaj	had the privilege of informing  Shiva  about  the  journey.  Shiva  though,  was not in the  most amenable		of moods.  He was  utterly perplexed	by the sudden devotion of every	Meluhan	around	him.  Since	he	had	been	transferred	to  the	gubernatorial residence	where   he  lived  in  luxury,   only  the  most  important  citizens	of Srinagar	had access		to him.</br></br>‘My Lord, we will be escorting you  to Devagiri,  our  capital.  It is  a  few  weeks’  journey from  here,’  said  Chenardhwaj  as  he  struggled  to  bend   his  enormous   and   muscular frame lower than he ever had.</br></br>I’m not going till somebody tells me what  is  going  on!  What  the  hell  is  this  damned legend of the Neelkanth?’ Shiva asked angrily.</br></br>‘My Lord, please have faith in us. You will know  the  truth soon.  The  emperor  himself  will tell you when you reach Devagiri.’</br></br>‘And what about my tribe?’</br></br>‘They will be given  lands  right  here  in  Kashmir,  my  Lord.  All the  resources  that  they need to lead a comfortable life will be provided for.’</br></br>‘Are they being held hostage?’</br></br>‘Oh no,  my Lord,’  said  a visibly disturbed  Chenardhwaj.	‘They are	your	tribe, my Lord. If I had my way, they would  live like nobility  for the rest  of their lives.  But the laws  cannot be broken, my Lord.  Not even  for you.  We  can  only  give  them  what  had  been  promised. In the  course   of time  my  Lord,  you  can  decide  to change	the laws you  feel  necessary. Then  we  could certainly  accommodate	them  anywhere.’</br></br>‘Please, my Lord,’ pleaded  Nandi.  ‘Have  faith in us.  You cannot  imagine  how important  you are to Meluha. We have  been  waiting  for a  very  long  time  for you.  We  need  your help.’</br></br>Please help me! Please!</br></br>The memory of another  desperate  plea  from a  distraught  woman  years  ago  returned  to haunt Shiva as he was stunned into silence.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>‘Your destiny  is much  larger  than these  massive	mountains.’</br></br>Nonsense!	I don’t deserve	any destiny.	If these people knew my guilt, they  would  stop this bullshit instantly!</br></br>‘I don’t know what to do, Bhadra.’</br></br>Shiva  was  sitting  in the  royal gardens	on the banks of the Dal Lake while his friend sat</br></br> 
at his  side,  carefully  filling some marijuana	into a chillum. As Bhadra used the lit stick to bring  the chillum  to life, Shiva  said  impatiently,   ‘That’s  a cue  for you to speak,	you fool.’ ‘No. That’s actually a cue for me to hand you the chillum, Shiva.’</br></br>‘Why  will you  not  council me?’  asked	Shiva  in anguish.	‘We  are  still the same	friends who never made a move without consulting each other!’</br></br>Bhadra smiled. ‘No we are not. You are the Chief now. The tribe lives and dies by your decisions. It cannot be corrupted by any other person’s  influence.  We  are  not  like  the Pakratis, where  the  Chief  has  to  listen  to  whoever  is  the  loudmouth  on  their  council. Only the chief’s wisdom is supreme amongst the Gunas. That is our tradition.’</br></br>Shiva raised his eyes in exasperation. ‘Some traditions are meant to be broken!’</br></br>Bhadra  stayed  silent.  Stretching  his  hand,  Shiva  grabbed  the  chillum  from Bhadra.  He took one deep puff, letting the marijuana spread its munificence into his body.</br></br>‘I’ve heard just one line about the legend  of the  Neelkanth,’  said  Bhadra.  ‘Apparently Meluha is in deep trouble and only the Neelkanth can save them.’</br></br>‘But I can’t  seem  to see  any  trouble  out here?  Everything  seems  perfect.  If they  want  to see real trouble we should take them to our land!’</br></br>Bhadra laughed slightiy.  ‘But  what  is  it about  the  blue  throat  that  makes  them  believe you can save them?’</br></br>‘Damned if I know! They are so much  more  advanced  than  us.  And yet  they  worship  me like I am some god. Just because of this blessed blue throat’</br></br>‘I think their medicines are magical  though.  Have  you  noticed  that the hump  on my back  has reduced a litde bit?’</br></br>‘Yes  it has!  Their doctors are seriously	gifted.’ ‘You know their doctors are called Brahmins?’</br></br>‘Like Ayurvati?’  asked Shiva, passing	the chillum back to Bhadra.</br></br>‘Yes.  But the  Brahmins   don’t just  cure  people.   They  are also  teachers,	lawyers,	priests, basically	any intellectual	profession.’</br></br>‘Talented people,’ sniffed Shiva.</br></br>‘That’s not all,’ said Bhadra, in between a long inhalation.</br></br>‘They have  a  concept  of  specialisation.  So  in  addition  to  the  Brahmins,  they  have  a group called Kshatriyas, who are the warriors  and  rulers.  Even  the  women  can  be Kshatriyas!’</br></br>‘Really? They allow women into their army?’</br></br>‘Well, apparently there aren’t  too many  female  Kshatriyas.  But yes,  they are  allowed  into the army.’</br></br>‘No wonder they are in trouble!’</br></br>The friends  laughed  loudly  at  the  strange  ways  of the  Meluhans.  Bhadra  took  another puff from the chillum before continuing his story. ‘And then they have Vaishyas, who are craftsmen,  traders  and  business   people   and  finally  the  Shudras   who  are   the  farmers and workers. And one caste cannot do another caste’s job.’</br></br>‘Hang on,’ said Shiva.  ‘That  means  that  since  you  are  a  warrior,  you  would  not  be allowed to trade at the marketplace?’</br></br>‘Yes.’</br></br>‘Bloody  stupid!  How would  you get  me my marijuana?	After all that is the only thing you are useful for!’</br></br>Shiva	leaned	back   to  avoid  the  playful  blow  from Bhadra.	‘All right, all right. Take it easy!’	he laughed.	Stretching	out, he grabbed	the chillum from Bhadra and took another deep drag.</br></br>We’re  talking about everything	except what we should be talking about.</br></br>Shiva  became	serious  again.  ‘But seriously,	strange	as they are, what should I do?’ ‘What are you thinking of doing?’</br></br>Shiva  looked  away,   as if contemplating	the  roses   in the  far corner  of the garden.	‘I don’t</br></br> 
want to run away once again.’</br></br>‘What?’ asked Bhadra, not hearing Shiva’s tormented whisper clearly.</br></br>‘I said,’ repeated	Shiva loudly, ‘I can’t bear the guilt of running away once again.’ ‘That wasn’t your fault...’</br></br>‘YES IT WAS!’</br></br>Bhadra	fell silent.	There	was	nothing   that   could  be  said.	Covering	his  eyes,	Shiva sighed once again. ‘Yes, it was...’</br></br>Bhadra	put  his   hand   on his  friend’s	shoulder,	pressing	it gently,	letting the terrible moment  pass.	Shiva   turned  his  face. ‘I’m asking		for advice,	my friend. What should I do?   If they  need   my  help,   I can’t turn away	from  them.   At the  same	time, how can I leave  our tribe  all by themselves	out here? What should I do?’</br></br>Bhadra continued to hold Shiva’s shoulder.  He  breathed  deeply.  He  could  think  of an answer. It may have been the correct answer for Shiva, his  friend  . But was  it the correct answer for Shiva, the leader !</br></br>‘You have to find that wisdom yourself, Shiva.  That is the tradition.’  ‘O the hell with you!’</br></br>Shiva threw the chillum back at Bhadra and stormed away.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>In was only a few days later that a minor caravan  consisting  of Shiva,  Nandi  and  three soldiers  was  scheduled  to  leave  Srinagar.  The  small  party   would   ensure   that  they moved quickly through the realm and reached Devagiri as soon as possible. Governor Chenardhwaj was anxious for Shiva to be recognised quickly by the empire as the true Neelkanth. He wanted to go down in history as the governor who found the Lord.</br></br>Shiva	had  been		made	‘presentable’		for  the  emperor.			His  hair   had  been		oiled and smoothened.	Lines		of expensive		clothes,	attractive	ear-rings,	necklaces	and	other jewellery		were   brought   to  adorn his muscular		frame. His fair face had been  scrubbed clean  with special			Ayurvedic	herbs   to remove  years		of dead   skin & decay.			A cravat had  been  fabricated			out  of  cotton  to  cover   his  glowing   blue throat.  Beads		had been cleverly		darned	on   to the  cravat	to  make		it  look  like  the  traditional	necklaces		that Meluhan		men  wore  while  on religious		exercises.	The cravat felt warm on his still cold throat.</br></br>‘I will  be  back  soon,’  said  Shiva   as he hugged	Bhadra’s	mother.   He was  amazed	that the old lady’s limp was a little less noticeable.</br></br>Their medicines	are truly magical	.</br></br>As a  morose  Bhadra   looked  at him,  Shiva  whispered,	‘Take care of the tribe. You are in charge till I come back.’</br></br>Bhadra	stepped	back,  starded.	‘Shiva	you  don’t  have   to  that just  because	I am your friend.’</br></br>‘I have   to do  it, you  fool.  And the reason	I have   to do  i that  you  are more  capable	than me.’</br></br>Bhadra	stepped	up and  embraced	Shiva,	lest  his  frie  notice  the  tears   in his eyes.	‘No Shiva, I am not. Not even my dreams.’</br></br>‘Shut up! Listen to me  carefully,’  said  Shiva  as  Bhai  smiled  sadly.  ‘I don’t  think  the  Gunas are at  any  risk  out here.  At least  not as  much  as  we  were  at  Mount  Kailash.  But  e\ then, if you feel  you  need  help,  ask  Ayurvati.  I saw  her  wl  the  tribe  was  ill.  She showed tremendous commitment save us all. She is worth trusting.’</br></br>Bhadra nodded, hugged Shiva again and left the room.</br></br> </br></br> 
Ayurvati knocked politely on the door. ‘May I come in, my Lord?’</br></br>This  was  the  first time  she  had  come  into his presence	since that fateful moment seven days   back.  It seemed	like  a  lifetime  to  her.  Though  she  appeared	to be her confident self again,		there   was   a  slightiy   different   look  about   her.  She   had the  appearance	of someone	who had been touched by the divine.</br></br>‘Come  in Ayurvati. And please,	none  of this “Lord” business.	I am still the same uncouth immigrant you met a few days ago.’</br></br>‘I am sorry about that comment,  my Lord. It was  wrong  of me  to say  that and  I am  willing to accept  any punishment	that you may deem fit.’</br></br>‘What’s  wrong  with  you?  Why  should  I punish  you  for speaking	the truth? Why should this  bloody  blue throat change	anything?’</br></br>‘You will discover	the reason,	my Lord,’ whispered	Ayurvati with her head bowed. We have  waited  for centuries	for you.’</br></br>‘Centuries?!	In the name of the holy lake, why? What  can  I do  that  any  of you  smart  people can’t?’</br></br>‘The emperor will tell you, my Lord. Suffice it to say  that  from all  that  I have  heard  from your tribe, if there is one person worthy of being the Neelkanth, it is you.’</br></br>‘Speaking	of my  tribe,  I have  told them  that  if they  need  any  help,  they can  request	you. I hope that is all right.’</br></br>‘It would  be  my honour  to provide any assistance	to them, my Lord.’</br></br>Saying	this, she bent down to touch Shiva’s feet in the traditional Indian form of showing respect.		Shiva  had resigned	himself  to accepting	this gesture	from most  Meluhans	but immediately	stepped back as Ayurvati bent down.</br></br>‘What  the  hell  are  you doing,  Ayurvati?’	asked	a horrified  Shiva.	You are a doctor, a giver  of life. Don’t embarrass	me by touching my feet.’</br></br>Ayurvati  looked  up  at Shiva,	her eyes	shining  with admiration	and devotion. This was certainly a man worthy of being the Neelkanth.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Nandi  entered  Shiva’s  room  carrying  a  saffron  cloth  with  the  word  ‘Ram’  stamped across every inch of it. He requested Shiva to wrap it around his  shoulders.  As  Shiva complied, Nandi muttered a quick short prayer for a safe journey to Devagiri.</br></br>‘Our horses wait outside, my  Lord.  We  can  leave  when  you  are  ready,’  said  Nandi. ‘Nandi,’  said  an  exasperated	Shiva.	‘How many	times   must   I tell  you?	My name	is Shiva. I am your friend, not your Lord’</br></br>‘Oh no,  my Lord,’ gasped	Nandi.  ‘You are the Neelkanth.	You are	the Lord. How can I take your name?’</br></br>Shiva   rolled his eyes,	shook his head slightiy  and  turned  towards  the  door.  ‘I give  up! Can we leave now?’</br></br>‘Of course, my Lord.’</br></br>They  stepped		outside	to see		three  mounted			soldiers	waiting patiently,	while tethered close   to  them  were   three more  horses.	One each for Shiva and  Nandi,  while  the  third was assigned	for carrying  their provisions.  The well-organised	Meluhan Empire had rest houses		and  provision  stores	spread	across		all major  travel  routes.	As long as there were	enough		provisions	for  just  one  day,	a  traveller		carrying	Meluhan	coins	could comfortably keep buying fresh provisions to last a journey of months.</br></br>Nandi’s  horse  had  been  tethered  next  to  a  small  platform.  The  platform  had   steps leading up to it from the other side. Clearly, this  was  convenient  infrastructure  for obese riders who found it a little cumbersome to climb onto a horse. Shiva looked at Nandi’s</br></br> 
enormous form, then at his unfortunate horse and then back at Nandi.</br></br>‘Aren’t there  any  laws  in Meluha  against	cruelty to animals?’	asked Shiva with the most sincere of expressions.</br></br>‘Oh yes,  my Lord. Very  strict  laws.  In Meluha  ALL life is precious.	In fact there are strict guidelines	as  to when  and  how  animals   can be slaughtered	and...’</br></br>Suddenly	Nandi stopped  speaking.	Shiva’s	joke  had finally breached	Nandi’s slow wit. They  both burst  out laughing   as Shiva  slapped	Nandi hard on his back.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Shiva’s	entourage	followed  the course  of the Jhelum   which   had resumed	its thunderous roar  as  it crashed	down  the lower Himalayas.	Once  on the magnificent	flat plains, the turbulent river calmed down once again and flowed  smoothly  on. Smooth  enough  for the group  to get  on  one  of the  many  public transport  barges	to sail quickly down to the town of Brihateshpuram.</br></br>From  there  on, they  went  east  by a well  laid  and  marked  road  through  Punjab,  the  heart of the  empire’s  northern reaches.		Punjab		literally meant the land of the five rivers . The land  of the  Indus,  Jhelum,	Chenab,		Ravi  and  Beas.	The four eastern		rivers  aspired	to grasp	the	grand	Indus,		which		flowed		farthest		to	the		west.		They	succeeded spectacularly,		after  convoluted	journeys	on  the  rich  plains  of Punjab.			The Indus itself found  comfort  and  succour		in the enormous,		all embracing	ocean.	The mystery	of the ocean’s		final destination	though was yet to be unravelled.</br></br>‘What is Ram?’	enquired	Shiva as he  looked  down  at  the  word  covering  every  inch  of his saffron cloth.</br></br>The three accompanying soldiers rode at a polite distance  behind  Shiva  and  Nandi.  Far enough not to overhear any conversation  but close  enough  to move  in quickly  at  the  first sign of trouble. It was a part of their standard Meluhan service rules.</br></br>‘Lord  Ram  was   the  emperor who established			our way of life, my Lord,’ replied Nandi. ‘He  lived  around  one  thousand	two hundred  years	ago.  He created			our systems,	our rules, our ideologies,	everything.		His reign  is known  simply as	‘Ram Rajya’	or ‘the rule of  Ram . The  term  ‘Ram  Rajya’ is considered		to be  the  gold standard		of how an empire must  be  administered,		to create			a  perfect	life  for  all its citizens.	Meluha		is still run according	to his principles. Jai Shri Ram.’</br></br>‘He must  have  been  quite  a  man!  For he truly created	a paradise		right here on earth.’ Shiva	did  not  lie  when   he  said	this.   He truly  believed	that   if there  was	a paradise somewhere,			it couldn’t		have	been	very   different  from Meluha.		This  was		a land of abundance,		of almost  ethereal	perfection! It was an empire ruled by clearly codified and just  laws,	to  which  every	Meluhan		was		subordinated,		including		the  emperor.	The country  supported		a  population  of nearly  eight  million,  which without exception		seemed well  fed,  healthy  and  wealthy. The average	intellect was exceptionally		high. They were a slightiy  serious   people,  but unfailingly  polite  and  civil. It seemed	to be a flawless		society where		everyone	knew	his   role  and  played	it perfectly.			They were conscious, nay obsessive, about their  duties.  The  simple  truth  hit  Shiva:  if  the  entire  society  was conscious of its duties, nobody would need  to  fight  for  their  individual  rights.  Since everybody’s   rights   would  be  automatically    taken   care   of  through    someone    else’s duties . Lord Ram was a genius!</br></br>Shiva  too repeated	Nandi’s cry, signifying	Glory to Lord Ram. ‘Jai Shri Ram.’</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Having left their horses at the government authorised crossing-house, they crossed the</br></br> 
river  Ravi,	close		to		Hariyupa  ,  or the	City  of  Hari . Shiva		lingered		there	admiring Hariyupa   at  a slight distance,	while his soldiers	waited   just  beyond his shadow,	having mounted  their freshly  allocated		horses   from the crossing-house			on the other side of the Ravi.	Hariyupa		was	a  much  larger		city  than  Srinagar	and  seemed	grand	from the outside.	Shiva	thought  seriously	about  exploring	the  magnificent	city but that would have  meant   a  delay   in the  trip to Devagiri.   Next to Hariyupa,	Shiva saw a construction project being  executed.		A new  platform  was  being  erected	as Hariyupa had grown too populous  to accommodate		everyone	on its existing platform.</br></br>How the  hell  do they  raise these  magnificent	platforms?</br></br>Shiva made a mental  note  to  visit  the  construction  site  on  his  return  journey.  At  a distance,  Jattaa,  the  captain  of the  river  crossing  house,  was  talking  to Nandi  while  he was about to climb the platform to mount his fresh horse.</br></br>‘Avoid the road via Jratakgiri,’  advised  Jattaa.  ‘There  was  a  terrorist  attack  there  last  night. All the Brahmins were killed and the village temple was destroyed.  The  terrorists escaped as usual before any backup soldiers could arrive.’</br></br>‘When in Lord Agni’s name will we fight back? We should attack their country!’ snarled a visibly angry Nandi.</br></br>‘I swear by Lord Indra, if I ever  find one  of these  Chandravanshi  terrorists,  I will cut  his body into minute pieces and feed it to the dogs,’ growled Jattaa,  clenching  his fists  tight. ‘Jattaa! We are followers of the  Suryavanshis.  We  cannot  even  think of barbaric  warfare such as that!’ said Nandi.</br></br>‘Do the terrorists follow the rules of war  when  they  attack  us?  Don’t they  kill unarmed men?’</br></br>‘That does not mean that we can  act  the  same  way,  Captain.  We  are  Meluhans!’  said Nandi shaking his head.</br></br>Jattaa  did  not counter  Nandi.  He  was  distracted  by  Shiva  still  waiting  at  a  distance.  ‘Is he with you?’ he asked.</br></br>‘Yes.’</br></br>‘He doesn’t wear a caste amulet. Is he a new immigrant?’</br></br>‘Yes.’  replied  Nandi, getting uncomfortable	answering	questions	about Shiva.</br></br>‘And you’re  going to Devagiri?’	asked	an increasingly	suspicious	Jattaa,	looking harder towards Shiva’s throat. ‘I’ve heard some rumours coming from Srinagar...’</br></br>Nandi interrupted  Jattaa	suddenly.	‘Thank you for your help, Captain Jattaa.’</br></br>Before Jattaa could  act  on  his  suspicions,  Nandi  quickly  climbed  the  platform,  mounted his horse  and  rode  towards  Shiva.  Reaching  quickly,  he  said,  ‘We  should  leave,  my Lord.’</br></br>Shiva	wasn’t	listening.		He was  perplexed	once  again		as he saw the proud  Captain Jattaa		on his  knees.		Jattaa	was   looking  directly  at Shiva	with his  hands	folded in a respectful	namaste.	He  appeared		to  be   mumbling	something	very	quickly.	Shiva couldn’t  be  sure  from that distance,	but it seemed	that the Captain was crying.  He shook his  head and whispered,		‘Why?’</br></br>‘We should  go, my Lord,’ repeated	Nandi, a  litde  louder. Shiva turned to him, nodded and kicked his horse into action.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Shiva   looked   to  his  left  as   he  rode  on  the  straight road,  observing	Nandi goading	his valiant  horse  along.   He turned  around  and  was  not surprised		to see his three bodyguard soldiers	riding at exactly	the  same	distance	as   before.   Not too close,	and yet, not too far. He glanced	back  at Nandi, suspicious	that the jewellery	Nandi wore was not merely ornamental.	He  wore   two  amulets		on his thick right arm. The first one  had  some symbolic		lines  which  Shiva	could   not  fathom.  The  second		one  appeared	to have an</br></br> 
animal etching. Probably a bull. One of his  gold  chains  had  a  pendant  shaped  like  a perfectly circular sun with rays streaming  outwards.  The  other  pendant  was  a  brown, elliptical seed-like object with small serrations all over it.</br></br>‘Can you tell me the significance of your jewellery or is that  also  a state  secret?’  teased Shiva.</br></br>‘Of course I can,  my  Lord,’  replied  Nandi  earnestly.  He  pointed  at  the  first amulet  that had been tied around his massive arm with a silky gold thread. This is the amulet which represents my caste.  The  lines  drawn  on  it  are  a  symbol  of  the  shoulders  of  the  Parmatma, the almighty . This means that I am a Kshatriya.’</br></br>‘I am sure there are clearly codified guidelines  for representing  the other castes  as  well.’ ‘Right you are, my Lord. You are exceptionally intelligent.’</br></br>‘No, I am  not. You people  are just exceptionally	predictable.’ Nandi smiled as Shiva continued. ‘So what are they?’</br></br>‘What are what, my Lord?’</br></br>‘The  symbols  for the Brahmins,  Vaishyas	and Shudras.’</br></br>Well,  if the  lines  are  drawn  to represent	the  head   of the Parmatma,	it would mean the wearer   is a  Brahmin.  The  symbol  for a Vaishya	would be the lines forming a symbol  of the  thighs   of the Parmatma.	And  the  feet  of the Parmatma	on the amulet would make the wearer a Shudra.’</br></br>‘Interesting,’	said  Shiva  with a  slight  frown.  ‘I imagine most Shudras	are not too pleased about their placement.’</br></br>Nandi  was quite surprised	at Shiva’s	comments.		He couldn’t  understand	why a Shudra would  have		a  problem   with  this  long  ordained	symbol.	But he kept quiet for fear of disagreeing	with his Lord.</br></br>‘And the other amulet?’	asked Shiva.</br></br>‘This second	amulet  depicts  my chosen-tribe.		Each  chosen-tribe	takes on jobs which fit its  profile. Every Meluhan,	under  the  advice   of their parents,	applies		for a chosen-tribe when  they  turn twenty—five	years		old. Brahmins		choose		from birds, while Kshatriyas apply	for animals.	Flowers	are		allocated	to Vaishyas	while  Shudras	must	choose amongst	fishes.		The  Allocation	Board	allocates		the  chosen-tribe		on  the  basis	of a rigorous examination		process.		You must  qualify  for a chosen-tribe		that represents	both your  ambitions	and  skills.  Choose			a tribe that is too mighty and you  will  embarrass yourself  throughout  your  life if your achievements	don’t measure up to the  standards  of that tribe. Choose a tribe  too lowly  and  you  will not be  doing  justice  to your  own  talents. My chosen-tribe is a bull. That is the animal that this amulet represents.’</br></br>‘And  if I am  not  being   rude,  what  does   a  bull  mean   in your  rank of Kshatriya	chosen- tribes?’</br></br>‘Well,  it’s not as  high as  a lion, tiger  or an elephant.	But it’s not a rat or a  pig  either!’ ‘Well,  as  far  as  I am concerned,	the  bull  can  beat   any  lion or elephant,’	smiled Shiva. And what  about  the pendants	on your chain?’</br></br>‘The brown seed is a representation of the last Mahadev, Lord Rudra. It symbolises the protection and  regeneration  of  life.  Even  divine  weapons  cannot  destroy  the  life  it protects.’</br></br>‘And the Sun?’</br></br>‘My Lord, the  sun  represents  the  fact  that  I am  a follower  of the   Suryavanshi   kings  — the kings who are the descendants of the Sun’</br></br>‘What? The Sun came down and some queen...’ teased an incredulous Shiva.</br></br>‘Of course		not,  my  Lord,’  laughed	Nandi.   ‘All it means	is that we follow the solar calendar.	So you could say that we are the followers of the “path of the sun”.  In practical  terms  it denotes	that  we  are  strong  and  steadfast.	We honour our word and keep our promises	even at the  cost  of  our  lives.  We  never  break  the  law.  We  deal  honourably even  with  those  who  are  dishonourable.	Like  the  Sun,  we  never  take  from anyone	but</br></br> 
always give to others. We sear  our duties  into our consciousness  so  that  we  may  never forget them.  Being  a Suryavanshi  means  that we  must  always  strive  to be honest,  brave and above all, loyal to the truth.’</br></br>‘A tall order! I assume that Lord Ram was a Suryavanshi king?’</br></br>‘Yes, of course,’ replied Nandi, his chest puffed up with pride.  ‘He was  the  Suryavanshi king. Jai Shri Ram.’</br></br>‘Jai Shri Ram,’ repeated Shiva.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Nandi  and  Shiva  crossed  the  river  Beas  on a  boat.  Their  three  soldiers   waited  to cross on the  following  craft.  The  Beas  was  the  last  river  to  be  crossed  after  which  stretched the straight road towards Devagiri. Unseasonal rain the previous night had made the crossing-house  captain  consider  cancelling  the   day’s   crossings   across   the   river. However  the  weather  had  been  relatively  calm  since  the  morning,  allowing   the  captain to keep the  service  operational.  Shiva  and  Nandi  shared  the  boat  with  two  other passengers as well as the boatman  who  rowed  them  across.  They  had  traded  in  their existing horses at the crossing-house for fresh horses on the other side.</br></br>They  were   a short  distance	from the  opposite		bank   when a sudden	burst of torrential rain  came   down  from the heavens.	The  winds  took  on a sudden		ferocity. The boatman made	a  valiant	effort   to row  quickly	across,		but  the   boat	tossed	violently	as	it surrendered	to the elements.		Nandi stretched		to tell Shiva to stay low for safety.  But he  did not do it gently  enough.   His considerable	weight caused	the boat to list dangerously, and he fell overboard.</br></br>The  boatman   tried to steady		the  boat  with his  rows  to save   the other passengers.	Even as  he  did  so,  he  had the presence	of mind to pull out his conch and blow  an  emergency call  to the crossing-house	on  the  other   side.   The  other  two passengers	should have jumped  overboard   to save   Nandi  but his massive	build  made them hesitate.		They knew that if they tried to save him, they would most likely drown.</br></br>Shiva   felt  no such  hesitation	as  he quickly  tossed		aside	his angvastram,		pulled off his shoes	and dived into the turbulent river. Shiva swam with powerful strokes  and  quickly reached		a  rapidly  drowning  Nandi.  He had  to use  all  of his considerable	strength to pull Nandi  to the surface.	In spite  of being  buoyed   by  the  water, Nandi weighed		significantiy more  than  what  any   normal   man   would.   It was   fortunate   that  Shiva felt stronger	than ever  since	the  first  night  at  the  Srinagar	immigration	camp.	Shiva	positioned	himself behind Nandi and wrapped  one  arm  around  his  chest.  He used  his  other  arm  to swim  to the  bank.  Nandi’s  weight  made   it very exhausting	work, but Shiva was able to tow the Meluhan		captain	to  the  shore   soon   as  the  emergency		staff from the crossing-house came rapidly towards them.</br></br>Shiva helped them drag Nandi’s limp body on to the land. He was unconscious.</br></br>The emergency	staff  then  began	a strange	procedure.	One   of them  started	pressing Nandi’s chest in a  quick  rhythmic  motion  to  the  count  of  five.  The  moment  he  would stop,  another  emergency		staff  would  cover  Nandi’s  lips  with  his  own and  breathe	hard into  his  mouth.   Then   they  would  repeat	the  procedure		all over  again.	Shiva		did not understand	what	was	going	on  but   trusted	both   the			knowledge	as		well		as		the commitment of the Meluhan medical personnel.</br></br>After several anxious  moments,  Nandi  suddenly  coughed  up  a  considerable  amount  of water and woke up  with  a  start.  At first  he  was  disoriented  but  he  quickly  regained  his wits and turned abruptly towards  Shiva,  screeching,  ‘My Lord, why  did you  jump  in after me? Your life is too precious. You must never risk it for me!’</br></br>A surprised Shiva supported Nandi’s back and whispered calmly, ‘You need to relax,  my friend.’</br></br> 
Agreeing	with Shiva,   the  medical   staff  quickly  placed   Nandi on a stretcher	to carry him into the  rest  house   that was  attached	to the crossing-house.	The other boat passengers were	looking  at  Shiva	with increasing		curiosity.	They   knew   that  the  fat  man  was	a relatively	senior		Suryavanshi	soldier,		judging	by his  amulets.		Yet he  called	this fair, caste-unmarked	man  ‘his Lord’. Strange.		But  all that mattered	was that the soldier was safe.  They dispersed	as Shiva followed the medical staff into the rest house.</br></br>
