        </br>
        Chenardhwaj, the governor of Kashmir, wanted to broadcast to the entire world that the</br>
        Neelkanth had appeared in his capital city. Not in the other frontier towns like</br>
        Takshashila, Karachapa or Lothal. His Srinagar! But the bird courier had arrived almost</br>
        immediately from the Meluhan capital Devagiri , the abode of the gods . The orders</br>
        were crystal clear. The news of the arrival of the Neelkanth had to be kept secret until</br>
        the emperor himself had seen Shiva. Chenardhwaj was ordered to send Shiva along</br>
        with an escort to Devagiri. Most importantly, Shiva himself was not to be told about the</br>
        legend. ‘The emperor will advise the supposed Neelkanth in an appropriate manner,’</br>
        were the exact words in the message.</br>
        Chenardhwaj had the privilege of informing Shiva about the journey. Shiva though, was</br>
        not in the most amenable of moods. He was utterly perplexed by the sudden devotion of</br>
        every Meluhan around him. Since he had been transferred to the gubernatorial</br>
        residence where he lived in luxury, only the most important citizens of Srinagar had</br>
        access to him.</br>
        ‘My Lord, we will be escorting you to Devagiri, our capital. It is a few weeks’ journey</br>
        from here,’ said Chenardhwaj as he struggled to bend his enormous and muscular</br>
        frame lower than he ever had.</br>
        I’m not going till somebody tells me what is going on! What the hell is this damned</br>
        legend of the Neelkanth?’ Shiva asked angrily.</br>
        ‘My Lord, please have faith in us. You will know the truth soon. The emperor himself will</br>
        tell you when you reach Devagiri.’</br>
        ‘And what about my tribe?’</br>
        ‘They will be given lands right here in Kashmir, my Lord. All the resources that they</br>
        need to lead a comfortable life will be provided for.’</br>
        ‘Are they being held hostage?’</br>
        ‘Oh no, my Lord,’ said a visibly disturbed Chenardhwaj. ‘They are your tribe, my Lord.</br>
        If I had my way, they would live like nobility for the rest of their lives. But the laws cannot</br>
        be broken, my Lord. Not even for you. We can only give them what had been promised.</br>
        In the course of time my Lord, you can decide to change the laws you feel necessary.</br>
        Then we could certainly accommodate them anywhere.’</br>
        ‘Please, my Lord,’ pleaded Nandi. ‘Have faith in us. You cannot imagine how important</br>
        you are to Meluha. We have been waiting for a very long time for you. We need your</br>
        help.’</br>
        Please help me! Please!</br>
        The memory of another desperate plea from a distraught woman years ago returned to</br>
        haunt Shiva as he was stunned into silence.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        ‘Your destiny is much larger than these massive mountains.’</br>
        Nonsense! I don’t deserve any destiny. If these people knew my guilt, they would stop</br>
        this bullshit instantly!</br>
        ‘I don’t know what to do, Bhadra.’</br>
        Shiva was sitting in the royal gardens on the banks of the Dal Lake while his friend sat</br>
        at his side, carefully filling some marijuana into a chillum. As Bhadra used the lit stick to</br>
        bring the chillum to life, Shiva said impatiently, ‘That’s a cue for you to speak, you fool.’</br>
        ‘No. That’s actually a cue for me to hand you the chillum, Shiva.’</br>
        ‘Why will you not council me?’ asked Shiva in anguish. ‘We are still the same friends</br>
        who never made a move without consulting each other!’</br>
        Bhadra smiled. ‘No we are not. You are the Chief now. The tribe lives and dies by your</br>
        decisions. It cannot be corrupted by any other person’s influence. We are not like the</br>
        Pakratis, where the Chief has to listen to whoever is the loudmouth on their council.</br>
        Only the chief’s wisdom is supreme amongst the Gunas. That is our tradition.’</br>
        Shiva raised his eyes in exasperation. ‘Some traditions are meant to be broken!’</br>
        Bhadra stayed silent. Stretching his hand, Shiva grabbed the chillum from Bhadra. He</br>
        took one deep puff, letting the marijuana spread its munificence into his body.</br>
        ‘I’ve heard just one line about the legend of the Neelkanth,’ said Bhadra. ‘Apparently</br>
        Meluha is in deep trouble and only the Neelkanth can save them.’</br>
        ‘But I can’t seem to see any trouble out here? Everything seems perfect. If they want to</br>
        see real trouble we should take them to our land!’</br>
        Bhadra laughed slightiy. ‘But what is it about the blue throat that makes them believe</br>
        you can save them?’</br>
        ‘Damned if I know! They are so much more advanced than us. And yet they worship me</br>
        like I am some god. Just because of this blessed blue throat’</br>
        ‘I think their medicines are magical though. Have you noticed that the hump on my back</br>
        has reduced a litde bit?’</br>
        ‘Yes it has! Their doctors are seriously gifted.’</br>
        ‘You know their doctors are called Brahmins?’</br>
        ‘Like Ayurvati?’ asked Shiva, passing the chillum back to Bhadra.</br>
        ‘Yes. But the Brahmins don’t just cure people. They are also teachers, lawyers, priests,</br>
        basically any intellectual profession.’</br>
        ‘Talented people,’ sniffed Shiva.</br>
        ‘That’s not all,’ said Bhadra, in between a long inhalation.</br>
        ‘They have a concept of specialisation. So in addition to the Brahmins, they have a</br>
        group called Kshatriyas, who are the warriors and rulers. Even the women can be</br>
        Kshatriyas!’</br>
        ‘Really? They allow women into their army?’</br>
        ‘Well, apparently there aren’t too many female Kshatriyas. But yes, they are allowed into</br>
        the army.’</br>
        ‘No wonder they are in trouble!’</br>
        The friends laughed loudly at the strange ways of the Meluhans. Bhadra took another</br>
        puff from the chillum before continuing his story. ‘And then they have Vaishyas, who are</br>
        craftsmen, traders and business people and finally the Shudras who are the farmers</br>
        and workers. And one caste cannot do another caste’s job.’</br>
        ‘Hang on,’ said Shiva. ‘That means that since you are a warrior, you would not be</br>
        allowed to trade at the marketplace?’</br>
        ‘Yes.’</br>
        ‘Bloody stupid! How would you get me my marijuana? After all that is the only thing you</br>
        are useful for!’</br>
        Shiva leaned back to avoid the playful blow from Bhadra. ‘All right, all right. Take it</br>
        easy!’ he laughed. Stretching out, he grabbed the chillum from Bhadra and took another</br>
        deep drag.</br>
        We’re talking about everything except what we should be talking about.</br>
        Shiva became serious again. ‘But seriously, strange as they are, what should I do?’</br>
        ‘What are you thinking of doing?’</br>
        Shiva looked away, as if contemplating the roses in the far corner of the garden. ‘I don’t</br>
        want to run away once again.’</br>
        ‘What?’ asked Bhadra, not hearing Shiva’s tormented whisper clearly.</br>
        ‘I said,’ repeated Shiva loudly, ‘I can’t bear the guilt of running away once again.’</br>
        ‘That wasn’t your fault...’</br>
        ‘YES IT WAS!’</br>
        Bhadra fell silent. There was nothing that could be said. Covering his eyes, Shiva</br>
        sighed once again. ‘Yes, it was...’</br>
        Bhadra put his hand on his friend’s shoulder, pressing it gently, letting the terrible</br>
        moment pass. Shiva turned his face. ‘I’m asking for advice, my friend. What should I</br>
        do? If they need my help, I can’t turn away from them. At the same time, how can I</br>
        leave our tribe all by themselves out here? What should I do?’</br>
        Bhadra continued to hold Shiva’s shoulder. He breathed deeply. He could think of an</br>
        answer. It may have been the correct answer for Shiva, his friend . But was it the correct</br>
        answer for Shiva, the leader !</br>
        ‘You have to find that wisdom yourself, Shiva. That is the tradition.’</br>
        ‘O the hell with you!’</br>
        Shiva threw the chillum back at Bhadra and stormed away.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        In was only a few days later that a minor caravan consisting of Shiva, Nandi and three</br>
        soldiers was scheduled to leave Srinagar. The small party would ensure that they</br>
        moved quickly through the realm and reached Devagiri as soon as possible. Governor</br>
        Chenardhwaj was anxious for Shiva to be recognised quickly by the empire as the true</br>
        Neelkanth. He wanted to go down in history as the governor who found the Lord.</br>
        Shiva had been made ‘presentable’ for the emperor. His hair had been oiled and</br>
        smoothened. Lines of expensive clothes, attractive ear-rings, necklaces and other</br>
        jewellery were brought to adorn his muscular frame. His fair face had been scrubbed</br>
        clean with special Ayurvedic        herbs to remove years of dead skin & decay. A cravat</br>
        had been fabricated out of cotton to cover his glowing blue throat. Beads had been</br>
        cleverly darned on to the cravat to make it look like the traditional necklaces that</br>
        Meluhan men wore while on religious exercises. The cravat felt warm on his still cold</br>
        throat.</br>
        ‘I will be back soon,’ said Shiva as he hugged Bhadra’s mother. He was amazed that</br>
        the old lady’s limp was a little less noticeable.</br>
        Their medicines    are truly magical .</br>
        As a morose Bhadra looked at him, Shiva whispered, ‘Take care of the tribe. You are in</br>
        charge till I come back.’</br>
        Bhadra stepped back, starded. ‘Shiva you don’t have to that just because I am your</br>
        friend.’</br>
        ‘I have to do it, you fool. And the reason I have to do i that you are more capable than</br>
        me.’</br>
        Bhadra stepped up and embraced Shiva, lest his frie notice the tears in his eyes. ‘No</br>
        Shiva, I am not. Not even my dreams.’</br>
        ‘Shut up! Listen to me carefully,’ said Shiva as Bhai smiled sadly. ‘I don’t think the</br>
        Gunas are at any risk out here. At least not as much as we were at Mount Kailash. But</br>
        e\ then, if you feel you need help, ask Ayurvati. I saw her wl the tribe was ill. She</br>
        showed tremendous commitment save us all. She is worth trusting.’</br>
        Bhadra nodded, hugged Shiva again and left the room.</br>
        Ayurvati knocked politely on the door. ‘May I come in, my Lord?’</br>
        This was the first time she had come into his presence since that fateful moment seven</br>
        days back. It seemed like a lifetime to her. Though she appeared to be her confident</br>
        self again, there was a slightiy different look about her. She had the appearance of</br>
        someone who had been touched by the divine.</br>
        ‘Come in Ayurvati. And please, none of this “Lord” business. I am still the same uncouth</br>
        immigrant you met a few days ago.’</br>
        ‘I am sorry about that comment, my Lord. It was wrong of me to say that and I am willing</br>
        to accept any punishment that you may deem fit.’</br>
        ‘What’s wrong with you? Why should I punish you for speaking the truth? Why should</br>
        this bloody blue throat change anything?’</br>
        ‘You will discover the reason, my Lord,’ whispered Ayurvati with her head bowed. We</br>
        have waited for centuries for you.’</br>
        ‘Centuries?! In the name of the holy lake, why? What can I do that any of you smart</br>
        people can’t?’</br>
        ‘The emperor will tell you, my Lord. Suffice it to say that from all that I have heard from</br>
        your tribe, if there is one person worthy of being the Neelkanth, it is you.’</br>
        ‘Speaking of my tribe, I have told them that if they need any help, they can request you.</br>
        I hope that is all right.’</br>
        ‘It would be my honour to provide any assistance to them, my Lord.’</br>
        Saying this, she bent down to touch Shiva’s feet in the traditional Indian form of showing</br>
        respect. Shiva had resigned himself to accepting this gesture from most Meluhans but</br>
        immediately stepped back as Ayurvati bent down.</br>
        ‘What the hell are you doing, Ayurvati?’ asked a horrified Shiva. You are a doctor, a</br>
        giver of life. Don’t embarrass me by touching my feet.’</br>
        Ayurvati looked up at Shiva, her eyes shining with admiration and devotion. This was</br>
        certainly a man worthy of being the Neelkanth.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Nandi entered Shiva’s room carrying a saffron cloth with the word ‘Ram’ stamped</br>
        across every inch of it. He requested Shiva to wrap it around his shoulders. As Shiva</br>
        complied, Nandi muttered a quick short prayer for a safe journey to Devagiri.</br>
        ‘Our horses wait outside, my Lord. We can leave when you are ready,’ said Nandi.</br>
        ‘Nandi,’ said an exasperated Shiva. ‘How many times must I tell you? My name is</br>
        Shiva. I am your friend, not your Lord’</br>
        ‘Oh no, my Lord,’ gasped Nandi. ‘You are the Neelkanth. You are the Lord. How can I</br>
        take your name?’</br>
        Shiva rolled his eyes, shook his head slightiy and turned towards the door. ‘I give up!</br>
        Can we leave now?’</br>
        ‘Of course, my Lord.’</br>
        They stepped outside to see three mounted soldiers waiting patiently, while tethered</br>
        close to them were three more horses. One each for Shiva and Nandi, while the third</br>
        was assigned for carrying their provisions. The well-organised Meluhan Empire had rest</br>
        houses and provision stores spread across all major travel routes. As long as there</br>
        were enough provisions for just one day, a traveller carrying Meluhan coins could</br>
        comfortably keep buying fresh provisions to last a journey of months.</br>
        Nandi’s horse had been tethered next to a small platform. The platform had steps</br>
        leading up to it from the other side. Clearly, this was convenient infrastructure for obese</br>
        riders who found it a little cumbersome to climb onto a horse. Shiva looked at Nandi’s</br>
        enormous form, then at his unfortunate horse and then back at Nandi.</br>
        ‘Aren’t there any laws in Meluha against cruelty to animals?’ asked Shiva with the most</br>
        sincere of expressions.</br>
        ‘Oh yes, my Lord. Very strict laws. In Meluha ALL life is precious. In fact there are strict</br>
        guidelines as to when and how animals can be slaughtered and...’</br>
        Suddenly Nandi stopped speaking. Shiva’s joke had finally breached Nandi’s slow wit.</br>
        They both burst out laughing as Shiva slapped Nandi hard on his back.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Shiva’s entourage followed the course of the Jhelum which had resumed its thunderous</br>
        roar as it crashed down the lower Himalayas. Once on the magnificent flat plains, the</br>
        turbulent river calmed down once again and flowed smoothly on. Smooth enough for the</br>
        group to get on one of the many public transport barges to sail quickly down to the town</br>
        of Brihateshpuram.</br>
        From there on, they went east by a well laid and marked road through Punjab, the heart</br>
        of the empire’s northern reaches. Punjab literally meant the land of the five rivers . The</br>
        land of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Beas. The four eastern rivers aspired to</br>
        grasp the grand Indus, which flowed farthest to the west. They succeeded</br>
        spectacularly, after convoluted journeys on the rich plains of Punjab. The Indus itself</br>
        found comfort and succour in the enormous, all embracing ocean. The mystery of the</br>
        ocean’s final destination though was yet to be unravelled.</br>
        ‘What is Ram?’ enquired Shiva as he looked down at the word covering every inch of</br>
        his saffron cloth.</br>
        The three accompanying soldiers rode at a polite distance behind Shiva and Nandi. Far</br>
        enough not to overhear any conversation but close enough to move in quickly at the first</br>
        sign of trouble. It was a part of their standard Meluhan service rules.</br>
        ‘Lord Ram was the emperor who established our way of life, my Lord,’ replied Nandi.</br>
        ‘He lived around one thousand two hundred years ago. He created our systems, our</br>
        rules, our ideologies, everything. His reign is known simply as ‘Ram Rajya’ or ‘the rule</br>
        of Ram . The term ‘Ram Rajya’ is considered to be the gold standard of how an empire</br>
        must be administered, to create a perfect life for all its citizens. Meluha is still run</br>
        according to his principles. Jai Shri Ram.’</br>
        ‘He must have been quite a man! For he truly created a paradise right here on earth.’</br>
        Shiva did not lie when he said this. He truly believed that if there was a paradise</br>
        somewhere, it couldn’t have been very different from Meluha. This was a land of</br>
        abundance, of almost ethereal perfection! It was an empire ruled by clearly codified and</br>
        just laws, to which every Meluhan was subordinated, including the emperor. The</br>
        country supported a population of nearly eight million, which without exception seemed</br>
        well fed, healthy and wealthy. The average intellect was exceptionally high. They were a</br>
        slightiy serious people, but unfailingly polite and civil. It seemed to be a flawless society</br>
        where everyone knew his role and played it perfectly. They were conscious, nay</br>
        obsessive, about their duties. The simple truth hit Shiva: if the entire society was</br>
        conscious of its duties, nobody would need to fight for their individual rights. Since</br>
        everybody’s    rights   would be automatically taken care of through someone           else’s</br>
        duties . Lord Ram was a genius!</br>
        Shiva too repeated Nandi’s cry, signifying Glory to Lord Ram. ‘Jai Shri Ram.’</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Having left their horses at the government authorised crossing-house,      they crossed the</br>
        river Ravi, close to Hariyupa , or the City of Hari . Shiva lingered there admiring</br>
        Hariyupa at a slight distance, while his soldiers waited just beyond his shadow, having</br>
        mounted their freshly allocated horses from the crossing-house on the other side of the</br>
        Ravi. Hariyupa was a much larger city than Srinagar and seemed grand from the</br>
        outside. Shiva thought seriously about exploring the magnificent city but that would</br>
        have meant a delay in the trip to Devagiri. Next to Hariyupa, Shiva saw a construction</br>
        project being executed. A new platform was being erected as Hariyupa had grown too</br>
        populous to accommodate everyone on its existing platform.</br>
        How the hell do they raise these magnificent platforms?</br>
        Shiva made a mental note to visit the construction site on his return journey. At a</br>
        distance, Jattaa, the captain of the river crossing house, was talking to Nandi while he</br>
        was about to climb the platform to mount his fresh horse.</br>
        ‘Avoid the road via Jratakgiri,’ advised Jattaa. ‘There was a terrorist attack there last</br>
        night. All the Brahmins were killed and the village temple was destroyed. The terrorists</br>
        escaped as usual before any backup soldiers could arrive.’</br>
        ‘When in Lord Agni’s name will we fight back? We should attack their country!’ snarled a</br>
        visibly angry Nandi.</br>
        ‘I swear by Lord Indra, if I ever find one of these Chandravanshi terrorists, I will cut his</br>
        body into minute pieces and feed it to the dogs,’ growled Jattaa, clenching his fists tight.</br>
        ‘Jattaa! We are followers of the Suryavanshis. We cannot even think of barbaric warfare</br>
        such as that!’ said Nandi.</br>
        ‘Do the terrorists follow the rules of war when they attack us? Don’t they kill unarmed</br>
        men?’</br>
        ‘That does not mean that we can act the same way, Captain. We are Meluhans!’ said</br>
        Nandi shaking his head.</br>
        Jattaa did not counter Nandi. He was distracted by Shiva still waiting at a distance. ‘Is</br>
        he with you?’ he asked.</br>
        ‘Yes.’</br>
        ‘He doesn’t wear a caste amulet. Is he a new immigrant?’</br>
        ‘Yes.’ replied Nandi, getting uncomfortable answering questions about Shiva.</br>
        ‘And you’re going to Devagiri?’ asked an increasingly suspicious Jattaa, looking harder</br>
        towards Shiva’s throat. ‘I’ve heard some rumours coming from Srinagar...’</br>
        Nandi interrupted Jattaa suddenly. ‘Thank you for your help, Captain Jattaa.’</br>
        Before Jattaa could act on his suspicions, Nandi quickly climbed the platform, mounted</br>
        his horse and rode towards Shiva. Reaching quickly, he said, ‘We should leave, my</br>
        Lord.’</br>
        Shiva wasn’t listening. He was perplexed once again as he saw the proud Captain</br>
        Jattaa on his knees. Jattaa was looking directly at Shiva with his hands folded in a</br>
        respectful namaste. He appeared to be mumbling something very quickly. Shiva</br>
        couldn’t be sure from that distance, but it seemed that the Captain was crying. He shook</br>
        his head and whispered, ‘Why?’</br>
        ‘We should go, my Lord,’ repeated Nandi, a litde louder.</br>
        Shiva turned to him, nodded and kicked his horse into action.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Shiva looked to his left as he rode on the straight road, observing Nandi goading his</br>
        valiant horse along. He turned around and was not surprised to see his three bodyguard</br>
        soldiers riding at exactly the same distance as before. Not too close, and yet, not too</br>
        far. He glanced back at Nandi, suspicious that the jewellery Nandi wore was not merely</br>
        ornamental. He wore two amulets on his thick right arm. The first one had some</br>
        symbolic lines which Shiva could not fathom. The second one appeared to have an</br>
        animal etching. Probably a bull. One of his gold chains had a pendant shaped like a</br>
        perfectly circular sun with rays streaming outwards. The other pendant was a brown,</br>
        elliptical seed-like object with small serrations all over it.</br>
        ‘Can you tell me the significance of your jewellery or is that also a state secret?’ teased</br>
        Shiva.</br>
        ‘Of course I can, my Lord,’ replied Nandi earnestly. He pointed at the first amulet that</br>
        had been tied around his massive arm with a silky gold thread. This is the amulet which</br>
        represents my caste. The lines drawn on it are a symbol of the shoulders of the</br>
        Parmatma, the almighty . This means that I am a Kshatriya.’</br>
        ‘I am sure there are clearly codified guidelines for representing the other castes as well.’</br>
        ‘Right you are, my Lord. You are exceptionally intelligent.’</br>
        ‘No, I am not. You people are just exceptionally predictable.’</br>
        Nandi smiled as Shiva continued. ‘So what are they?’</br>
        ‘What are what, my Lord?’</br>
        ‘The symbols for the Brahmins, Vaishyas and Shudras.’</br>
        Well, if the lines are drawn to represent the head of the Parmatma, it would mean the</br>
        wearer is a Brahmin. The symbol for a Vaishya would be the lines forming a symbol of</br>
        the thighs of the Parmatma. And the feet of the Parmatma on the amulet would make</br>
        the wearer a Shudra.’</br>
        ‘Interesting,’ said Shiva with a slight frown. ‘I imagine most Shudras are not too pleased</br>
        about their placement.’</br>
        Nandi was quite surprised at Shiva’s comments. He couldn’t understand why a Shudra</br>
        would have a problem with this long ordained symbol. But he kept quiet for fear of</br>
        disagreeing with his Lord.</br>
        ‘And the other amulet?’ asked Shiva.</br>
        ‘This second amulet depicts my chosen-tribe. Each chosen-tribe takes on jobs which fit</br>
        its profile. Every Meluhan, under the advice of their parents, applies for a chosen-tribe</br>
        when they turn twenty—five years old. Brahmins choose from birds, while Kshatriyas</br>
        apply for animals. Flowers are allocated to Vaishyas while Shudras must choose</br>
        amongst fishes. The Allocation Board allocates the chosen-tribe on the basis of a</br>
        rigorous examination process. You must qualify for a chosen-tribe that represents both</br>
        your ambitions and skills. Choose a tribe that is too mighty and you will embarrass</br>
        yourself throughout your life if your achievements don’t measure up to the standards of</br>
        that tribe. Choose a tribe too lowly and you will not be doing justice to your own talents.</br>
        My chosen-tribe is a bull. That is the animal that this amulet represents.’</br>
        ‘And if I am not being rude, what does a bull mean in your rank of Kshatriya chosen-</br>
        tribes?’</br>
        ‘Well, it’s not as high as a lion, tiger or an elephant. But it’s not a rat or a pig either!’</br>
        ‘Well, as far as I am concerned, the bull can beat any lion or elephant,’ smiled Shiva.</br>
        And what about the pendants on your chain?’</br>
        ‘The brown seed is a representation of the last Mahadev, Lord Rudra. It symbolises the</br>
        protection and regeneration of life. Even divine weapons cannot destroy the life it</br>
        protects.’</br>
        ‘And the Sun?’</br>
        ‘My Lord, the sun represents the fact that I am a follower of the Suryavanshi            kings —</br>
        the kings who are the descendants        of the Sun’</br>
        ‘What? The Sun came down and some queen...’ teased an incredulous Shiva.</br>
        ‘Of course not, my Lord,’ laughed Nandi. ‘All it means is that we follow the solar</br>
        calendar. So you could say that we are the followers of the “path of the sun”. In practical</br>
        terms it denotes that we are strong and steadfast. We honour our word and keep our</br>
        promises even at the cost of our lives. We never break the law. We deal honourably</br>
        even with those who are dishonourable. Like the Sun, we never take from anyone but</br>
        always give to others. We sear our duties into our consciousness so that we may never</br>
        forget them. Being a Suryavanshi means that we must always strive to be honest, brave</br>
        and above all, loyal to the truth.’</br>
        ‘A tall order! I assume that Lord Ram was a Suryavanshi king?’</br>
        ‘Yes, of course,’ replied Nandi, his chest puffed up with pride. ‘He was the Suryavanshi</br>
        king. Jai Shri Ram.’</br>
        ‘Jai Shri Ram,’ repeated Shiva.</br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        </br>
        Nandi and Shiva crossed the river Beas on a boat. Their three soldiers waited to cross</br>
        on the following craft. The Beas was the last river to be crossed after which stretched</br>
        the straight road towards Devagiri. Unseasonal rain the previous night had made the</br>
        crossing-house      captain consider cancelling the day’s crossings across the river.</br>
        However the weather had been relatively calm since the morning, allowing the captain</br>
        to keep the service operational. Shiva and Nandi shared the boat with two other</br>
        passengers as well as the boatman who rowed them across. They had traded in their</br>
        existing horses at the crossing-house for fresh horses on the other side.</br>
        They were a short distance from the opposite bank when a sudden burst of torrential</br>
        rain came down from the heavens. The winds took on a sudden ferocity. The boatman</br>
        made a valiant effort to row quickly across, but the boat tossed violently as it</br>
        surrendered to the elements. Nandi stretched to tell Shiva to stay low for safety. But he</br>
        did not do it gently enough. His considerable weight caused the boat to list dangerously,</br>
        and he fell overboard.</br>
        The boatman tried to steady the boat with his rows to save the other passengers. Even</br>
        as he did so, he had the presence of mind to pull out his conch and blow an emergency</br>
        call to the crossing-house on the other side. The other two passengers should have</br>
        jumped overboard to save Nandi but his massive build made them hesitate. They knew</br>
        that if they tried to save him, they would most likely drown.</br>
        Shiva felt no such hesitation as he quickly tossed aside his angvastram, pulled off his</br>
        shoes and dived into the turbulent river. Shiva swam with powerful strokes and quickly</br>
        reached a rapidly drowning Nandi. He had to use all of his considerable strength to pull</br>
        Nandi to the surface. In spite of being buoyed by the water, Nandi weighed significantiy</br>
        more than what any normal man would. It was fortunate that Shiva felt stronger than</br>
        ever since the first night at the Srinagar immigration camp. Shiva positioned himself</br>
        behind Nandi and wrapped one arm around his chest. He used his other arm to swim to</br>
        the bank. Nandi’s weight made it very exhausting work, but Shiva was able to tow the</br>
        Meluhan captain to the shore soon as the emergency staff from the crossing-house</br>
        came rapidly towards them.</br>
        Shiva helped them drag Nandi’s limp body on to the land. He was unconscious.</br>
        The emergency staff then began a strange procedure. One of them started pressing</br>
        Nandi’s chest in a quick rhythmic motion to the count of five. The moment he would</br>
        stop, another emergency staff would cover Nandi’s lips with his own and breathe hard</br>
        into his mouth. Then they would repeat the procedure all over again. Shiva did not</br>
        understand what was going on but trusted both the knowledge as well as the</br>
        commitment of the Meluhan medical personnel.</br>
        After several anxious moments, Nandi suddenly coughed up a considerable amount of</br>
        water and woke up with a start. At first he was disoriented but he quickly regained his</br>
        wits and turned abruptly towards Shiva, screeching, ‘My Lord, why did you jump in after</br>
        me? Your life is too precious. You must never risk it for me!’</br>
        A surprised Shiva supported Nandi’s back and whispered calmly, ‘You need to relax, my</br>
        friend.’</br>
        Agreeing with Shiva, the medical staff quickly placed Nandi on a stretcher to carry him</br>
        into the rest house that was attached to the crossing-house. The other boat passengers</br>
        were looking at Shiva with increasing curiosity. They knew that the fat man was a</br>
        relatively senior Suryavanshi soldier, judging by his amulets. Yet he called this fair,</br>
        caste-unmarked man ‘his Lord’. Strange. But all that mattered was that the soldier was</br>
        safe. They dispersed as Shiva followed the medical staff into the rest house.</br>
