  </br>1900 BC, Mansarovar Lake(At the foot of Mount Kailash, Tibet)</br></br>Shiva  gazed  at  the  orange  sky.  The  clouds  hovering  above  Mansarovar   had  just  parted to reveal the setting sun. The  brilliant  giver  of life was  calling  it a day  once  again.  Shiva had  seen  a  few  sunrises  in his  twenty-one  years.  But the  sunset!  He tried  never  to miss the sunset! On any other day, Shiva would have taken  in the  vista  — the  sun  and  the immense  lake  against  the  magnificent  backdrop  of the  Himalayas   stretching   as  far back as the eye could see. But not today.</br></br>He  squatted  and  perched  his  lithe,  muscular  body  on  the  narrow  ledge  extending   over the  lake.  The  numerous  batde-scars  on  his  skin  gleamed   in  the  shimmering   reflected light  of  the  waters.  Shiva  remembered  well  his  carefree  childhood  days.   He  had perfected the  art  of throwing  pebbles  that  bounced  off the  surface  of the  lake.  He  still  held the record in his tribe for the highest number of bounces: seventeen.</br></br>On a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at  the  memory  from a  cheerful  past  that  had been overwhelmed by the angst  of the  present.  But today,  he  turned  back  towards  his  village without any hint of joy.</br></br>Bhadra was  alert,  guarding  the  main  entrance.  Shiva  gestured  with  his  eyes.  Bhadra turned back to find his  two  back-up  soldiers  dozing  against  the  fence.  He  cursed  and kicked them hard.</br></br>Shiva turned back towards the lake.</br></br>God bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility.</br></br>Shiva brought the chillum  made  of yak-bone  to  his  hps  and  took  in  a  deep  drag.  Any other day,  the  marijuana  would  have  spread  its  munificence,  dulling  his  troubled  mind and letting him find some moments of solace. But not today.</br></br>He  looked  left,  at  the  edge   of the  lake  where  the soldiers	of the strange	foreign visitor were   kept  under  guard.   With  the  lake  behind   them  and  twenty of Shiva’s		own soldiers guarding  them,  it was impossible	for them to mount any surprise attack.</br></br>They let themselves	be disarmed	so easily.	They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our land  who are  looking  for any excuse	to fight.</br></br>The foreigner’s	words came flooding back to Shiva. ‘Come to our land.  It lies  beyond  the great	mountains.	Others   call  it Meluha.		I  call  it Heaven.	It  is the  richest	and most powerful empire in India. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our government	has  an  offer for immigrants.	You will be  given  fertile  land and resources	for farming. Today, your tribe, the Gunas, fight for survival  in this  rough,  arid  land.  Meluha offers  you  a  lifestyle  beyond  your wildest  dreams.	We ask for nothing  in return.  Just  live in peace,	pay your taxes and follow the laws of the land.’</br></br>Shiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land. Would I really miss that so much?</br></br>His  tribe  would  have   to  live  by  the  laws   of the  foreigners.	They would have to work every day for a living.</br></br>That’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive!</br></br>Shiva took another puff from his chillum.  As the  smoke  cleared,  he  turned  to stare  at  the hut in the centre of his village, right next  to  his  own,  where  the  foreigner  had  been stationed.  He  had  been  told  that  he  could  sleep  there  in comfort.  In fact,  Shiva   wanted to keep him hostage. Just in case.</br></br> 
We fight almost every  month  with the  Pakratis  just  so  that  our  village  can  exist  next  to the holy  lake.  They  are  getting  stronger  every  year,  forming  new  alliances  with  new tribes. We can beat the Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes  together!  By  moving  to Meluha, we can escape this  pointless  violence  and  may  be  live  a  life of comfort.  What could possibly be wrong with that? Why shouldn’t  we  take  this deal?  It sounds  so  damn good!</br></br>Shiva took one last  drag  from the  chillum  before  banging  it on  the  rock,  letting  the  ash slip out and rose quickly from  his  perch.  Brushing  a  few  specks  of ash  from  his  bare  chest, he wiped  his  hands  on  his  tiger  skin  skirt,  rapidly  striding  to his  village.  Bhadra and  his  back-up  stood  to  attention  as  Shiva  passed  the  gate.   Shiva   frowned   and gestured for Bhadra to ease up.</br></br>Why  does   he  keep   forgetting   that  he  has   been my closestfriend	since  childhood?	My becoming	the		chief	hasn’t	really	changed	anything.	He  doesn’t	need	to behave unnecessarily	servile in front of others.</br></br>The  huts  in Shiva’s	village	were  luxurious	compared	to others in their land. A grown man	could	actually		stand	upright	in  them.	The  shelter		could	withstand		the harsh mountain  winds  for nearly  three  years  before surrendering	to the elements.	He flung the empty  chillum  into his  hut as  he  strode  to the  hut where  the  visitor lay sleeping		soundly. Either  he doesn’t  realise	he  is a hostage.	Or he genuinely	believes		that good behaviour begets		good behaviour.</br></br>Shiva  remembered	what  his  uncle,   also   his  Guru,  used  to say.	‘People	do what their society rewards them to do. If the society rewards trust, people will be trusting.’</br></br>Meluha   must  he  a trusting  society	if it teaches	even  its soldiers	to expect	the best in strangers.</br></br>Shiva  scratched	his shaggy	beard as he stared hard  at the visitor.  He had said his name was Nandi.</br></br>The Meluhan’s	massive	proportions  appeared	even  more  enormous	as  he sprawled	on the   floor  in his  stupor,		his  immense	belly jiggling	with every	breath.		Despite	being obese,	his  skin  was	taut  and  toned.	His child-like		face	looked  even	more innocent asleep,	with his mouth half open.</br></br>Is  this  the  man  who  will lead  me  to my destiny?	Do I really have the destiny my uncle spoke of?</br></br>‘Your destiny   is  much  larger   than these  massive		mountains.	But to make it come true, you  will have  to cross  these  very same  massive	mountains.’</br></br>Do I deserve	a good destiny?	My people come first. Will they be happy in Meluha?</br></br>Shiva  continued	to  stare   at the  sleeping	Nandi. Then he heard the sound  of  a  conch shell.</br></br>Pakratis!</br></br>‘POSITIONS!’ screamed	Shiva, as he drew his sword.</br></br>Nandi was up in an instant, drawing  a  hidden  sword  from  his  fur coat  kept  to the  side. They  sprinted  to  the  village  gates.  Following  standard  protocol,  the  women  started rushing to the village centre, carrying their children along. The  men  ran  the  other  way, swords drawn.</br></br>‘Bhadra! Our soldiers at the lake!’ shouted Shiva as he reached the entrance.</br></br>Bhadra  relayed	the  orders  and  the  Guna  soldiers  obeyed  instantly.  They  were  surprised to  see  the Meluhans	draw  weapons	hidden   in  their  coats   and  rush  to the village.	The Pakratis were upon them within moments.</br></br>It was a well-planned ambush by the Pakratis. Dusk was usually  a  time  when  the  Guna soldiers took time to  thank  their  gods  for  a  day  without  battle.  The  women  did  their chores  by  the  lakeside.  If there  was   a  time  of weakness   for the  formidable   Gunas,   a time when they weren’t a fearsome martial clan, but just another mountain tribe  trying  to survive in a tough, hostile land, this was it.</br></br> 
But fate was against the Pakratis yet  again.  Thanks  to the  foreign  presence,  Shiva  had ordered the Gunas to remain alert. Thus they were forewarned  and  the  Pakratis  lost  the element  of surprise.  The presence  of the Meluhans  was  also  decisive,   turning  the tide of  the short, brutal battle in favour of the Gunas. The Pakratis had to retreat.</br></br>Bloodied  and scarred,	Shiva  surveyed	the damage	at the end of the battle. Two Guna soldiers	had succumbed		to their  injuries.   They  would  be  honoured   as clan  heroes.	But even worse, the warning had  come  too  late  for at  least  ten  Guna  women  and  children. Their  mutilated  bodies  were  found  next  to the  lake. The losses	were high.</br></br>Bastards	They kill women and children when they can’t beat us!</br></br>A livid Shiva called the entire tribe to the centre of the village. His mind was made.</br></br>‘This land is fit for barbarians! We have fought pointless battles  with no end  in sight.  You know my uncle tried  to  make  peace,  even  offering  access  to  the  lake  shore  to  the mountain  tribes.  But  these  scum  mistook  our  desire   for peace   as  weakness.   We  all  know what followed!’</br></br>The  Gunas,  despite  being  used  to the  brutality  of regular  battle,  were  shell-shocked   by the viciousness of the attack on the women and children.</br></br>‘I keep	nothing	secret	from  you.   All  of  you   know  the  invitation	of the foreigners,’ continued  Shiva,  pointing  to Nandi  and  the Meluhans.	‘They fought shoulder-to-shoulder with  us  today.   They have  earned	my  trust.  I want  to  go  with  them to Meluha.	But this cannot be my decision alone.’</br></br>‘You  are   our chief,  Shiva,’	said	Bhadra.	‘Your decision	is  our  decision.	That is the tradition.’</br></br>‘Not this  time,’  said  Shiva  holding  out his  hand.  ‘This will change	our lives completely.	I believe	the change	will be  for the  better.  Anything  will  be  better  than  the  pointlessness of the violence we face  daily.  I have  told you  what  I want  to do.  But  the  choice  to go  or not is  yours.  Let the Gunas  speak.	This time, I follow you.’</br></br>The Gunas were clear on their tradition. But the respect for Shiva was not just based on convention, but also on his character. He  had  led  the  Gunas  to  their  greatest  military victories through his genius and sheer personal bravery.</br></br>They  spoke  in one  voice.  ‘Your decision  is our decision.’</br></br> </br></br></br></br>It had been five days since Shiva  had  uprooted  his  tribe.  The  caravan  had  camped  in a  nook at the base of one of the  great  valleys  dotting  the  route  to  Meluha.  Shiva  had organized the camp in three  concentric  circles.  The  yaks  had  been  tied  around  the outermost circle,  to act  as  an  alarm  in case  of any  intruders.  The  men  were  stationed  in the intermediate ring to fight  if there  was  a  battle.  And  the  women  and  children  were  in the  innermost  circle,  just  around  the  fire.  Expendable  first,  defenders  second  and   the most vulnerable at the inside.</br></br>Shiva was  prepared  for the  worst.  He  believed  that  there  would  be  an  ambush.  It was only a matter of time.</br></br>The Pakratis	should  have  been  delighted	to have  access	to the prime lands, as well as free occupation	of the  lake  front.  But  Shiva   knew that Yakhya,	the Pakrati chief, would not allow  them  to leave  peacefully.	Yakhya   would  like  nothing  better  than to become	a legend	by claiming	that   he  had  defeated		Shiva’s	Gunas	and won the land for the Pakratis.		It was  precisely	this weird tribal logic that Shiva  detested.	In an atmosphere like this, there was never any hope for peace.</br></br>Shiva  relished	the  call  of battle,  revelled	in its  art.  But  he  also  knew that ultimately,	the battles  in his  land  were an exercise	in futility.</br></br>He  turned	to  an   alert   Nandi  sitting  some	distance	away.	The  twenty-five	Meluhan soldiers  were seated	in an arc around a second camp circle.</br></br> 
Why did he pick the Gunas to immigrate? Why not the Pakratis?</br></br>Shiva’s  thoughts  were  broken  as  he  saw  a  shadow   move  in  the  distance.   He  stared hard, but everything was still. Sometimes the  light played  tricks  in this part  of the  world. Shiva relaxed his stance.</br></br>And then he saw the shadow again. ‘TO ARMS!’ screamed Shiva.</br></br>The  Gunas  and  Meluhans  drew  their  weapons  and  took  up  battle  positions  as  fifty Pakratis  charged  in.  The  stupidity  of rushing  in  without  thought  hit  them  hard  as  they met with a wall of panicky animals. The yaks bucked  and  kicked  uncontrollably,  injuring many Pakratis before they could even begin their skirmish. A few slipped  through.  And weapons clashed.</br></br>A young  Pakrati,	obviously   a novice,  charged	at Shiva,		swinging	wildly. Shiva stepped back,  avoiding	the strike. He brought his sword back up in a smooth arc, inflicting a  superficial	cut   on the  Pakrati’s	chest.	The  young	warrior  cursed	and  swung	back, opening   his  flank.  That  was  all Shiva  needed.		He pushed	his sword in brutally, cutting through  the  gut  of his enemy.	Almost instantly, he pulled the blade  out, twisting  it as  he did, and left the Pakrati  to a  slow,  painful  death.  Shiva  turned  around  to find  a  Pakrati ready	to  strike   a  Guna.   He  jumped   high and  swung		from the  elevation	slicing neatly through the Pakrati’s	sword arm, severing		it.</br></br>Meanwhile	Bhadra,	as  adept	at  the  art  of  battle  as  Shiva,	was fighting two Pakratis simultaneously,	with  a  sword  in each	hand.   His  hump   did not  seem	to impeded	his movements		as  he  transferred		his weight  easily,	striking  the Pakrati	on his left on his throat.  Leaving   him to die  slowly,  he  swung   with his  right  hand, cutting  across	the face of  the other  soldier,		gouging	his  eye   out.  As  the  soldier  fell, Bhadra	brought his left sword  down  brutally,  ending  the suffering  quickly  for this hapless	enemy.</br></br>The battle at the Meluhan end of camp was very different. They were exceptionally  well- trained soldiers. But they were not vicious.  They  were  following  rules,  avoiding  killing, as far as possible.</br></br>Outnumbered and led poorly, it was but a short while before  the  Pakratis  were  beaten. Almost half of them lay dead and the rest were on their knees, begging for mercy.</br></br>One of them  was  Yakhya,  his  shoulder  cut deep  by Nandi,  debilitating  the  movement  of his sword arm.</br></br>Bhadra stood behind  the  Pakrati  chief,  his  sword  raised  high,  ready  to  strike.  ‘Shiva, quick and easy or slow and painful?’</br></br>‘Sir!’ intervened	Nandi,  before  Shiva could speak.	Shiva turned towards the Meluhan. ‘This is wrong!  They  are  begging  for mercy!  Killing them is against	the rules of war.’</br></br>‘You don’t know the Pakratis!’	said  Shiva.  ‘They  are  brutal.  They  will keep  attacking	us even if there is nothing to gain. This has to end. Once and for all.’</br></br>‘It is already	ending.	You  are   not  going   to live  here	anymore.	You will soon be in Meluha.’</br></br>Shiva stood silent.</br></br>Nandi continued, ‘How you want to end this is up to you. More of the same or different?’ Bhadra looked at Shiva. Waiting.</br></br>‘You  can  show the Pakratis	that you are better,’ said Nandi. Shiva turned towards the horizon, seeing	the massive	mountains.</br></br>Destiny? Chance of a better life?</br></br>He turned  back  to Bhadra.   ‘Disarm  them.  Take  all their provisions.  Release	them.’</br></br>Even  if the Pakratis	are mad enough  to go  back  to their  village,  rearm  and  come  back, we would be long gone.</br></br>A shocked   Bhadra  stared  at Shiva.  But immediately	started  implementing	the order. Nandi gazed	at  Shiva   with  hope.  There  was   but  one  thought that reverberated	through his mind.	‘Shiva	has the heart.	He has the potential.		Please,	let it be him. I pray to you</br></br> 
Lord Ram, let it be him.’</br></br>Shiva walked back to the  young  soldier  he  had  stabbed.  He  lay  writhing  on the  ground, face contorted in pain, as blood oozed slowly out of his guts. For this  first time  in his  life, Shiva felt pity for a Pakrati. He drew his sword and ended the young soldier’s suffering.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>After  marching  continuously  for four  weeks,  the  caravan  of invited  immigrants   crested the final mountain to reach the outskirts of Srinagar, the capital of the  valley  of Kashmir. Nandi had talked excitedly about  the  glories  of  his  perfect  land.  Shiva  had  prepared himself to see some incredible sights, which he could not have imagined in his simple homeland. But nothing  could  have  primed  him  for the  sheer  spectacle  of what  certainly was paradise. Meluha . The land of pure life!</br></br>The  mighty  Jhelum  river,  a roaring  tigress   in the  mountains,   slowed  down  to the  beat  of a  languorous  cow  as  she  entered  the  valley.  She  caressed   the   heavenly   land   of Kashmir,  meandering  her  way  into  the  immense  Dal  Lake.  Further  down,   she   broke away from the lake, continuing her journey to the sea.</br></br>The vast valley was covered by a lush green canvas  of grass.  On  it was  painted  the masterpiece that was Kashmir. Rows  upon  rows  of flowers  arrayed  all  of God’s  colours, their brilliance broken only by the soaring Chinar trees, offering  a  majestic,  yet  warm Kashmiri welcome. The melodious  singing  of  the  birds  calmed  the  exhausted  ears  of Shiva’s tribe, accustomed only to the rude howling of icy mountain winds.</br></br>‘If this is the border province, how perfect  must  the  rest  of the  country  be?’  whispered Shiva in awe.</br></br>The Dal Lake was the site of an ancient army  camp  of the  Meluhans.  Upon the  western banks  of the lake,  by the side  of the Jhelum  lay  the frontier town that had  grown  beyond   its simple encampments into the grand Srinagar . Literally, the ‘respected city’ .</br></br>Srinagar		had  been  raised	upon  a  massive		platform   of  almost  a  hundred	hectares		in size. The platform built of earth, towered  almost  five  metres  high.  On top of the  platform were the city  walls,  which  were  another  twenty  metres  in height  and  four  metres  thick. The  simplicity	and  brilliance	of  building   an   entire   city   on  a platform  astounded	the Gunas.   It was  a  strong protection  against	enemies		who would have to fight up a fort wall which was essentially		solid  ground.   The  platform  served   another vital purpose:	it raised the  ground  level  of the  city, an extremely		effective  strategy	against	the recurrent floods in this land. Inside the fort walls,  the  city  was  divided  into blocks  by  roads  laid  out  in a neat  grid  pattern.  It had specially	constructed			market  areas,		temples,	gardens,	meeting halls  and everything	else   that  would be required	for sophisticated	urban living. All the houses	looked  like simple multiple-storeyed		block structures			from the outside. The only way to differentiate a rich man’s house was that his block would be bigger.</br></br>In contrast	to the extravagant	natural  landscape		of Kashmir,   the  city of Srinagar	itself was  painted   only in restrained	greys,	blues and whites. The entire city was a picture of cleanliness,		order  and  sobriety.	Nearly	twenty	thousand	souls	called	Srinagar	their home.   Now an  additional	two  hundred   had  just  arrived   from Mount Kailash.	And their leader   felt a lightness	of being  he hadn’t experienced	since that terrible day, many years ago.</br></br>I have  escaped.	I can  make  a new beginning.	I can forget.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>The caravan	travelled   to the  immigrant  camp outside  Srinagar.	The camp had been built on a separate		platform on the southern side of the city. Nandi led Shiva and his tribe to</br></br> 
the Foreigners’	Office,  which  was  placed   just  outside  the  camp. Nandi requested	Shiva   to  wait  outside   as  he  went  into  the  office.  He soon  returned,	accompanied	by a young official.  The  official  gave a practised		smile and folded his hands in a formal namaste. ‘Welcome	to Meluha.   I am Chitraangadh.	I will be  your Orientation  Executive.	Think of me  as  your  single	point  of contact	for all issues	whilst  you  are  here.	I believe		your leader’s	name is Shiva. Will he step up please?’</br></br>Shiva took a step forward. ‘I am Shiva.’</br></br>‘Excellent,’ said Chitraangadh.	‘Would you be so kind as to follow me to the  registration desk  please?	You will be registered	as  the caretaker	of your tribe. Any communication that  concerns		them   will go  through		you.  Since	you   are  the  designated	leader,	the implementation			of all directives	within your tribe would be your responsibility’</br></br>Nandi  cut into Chitraangadh’s	officious speech	to tell Shiva, ‘Sir, if you will just excuse me,	I  will   go   to the  immigrant	camp	quarters	and	arrange	the  temporary	living arrangements	for your tribe.’</br></br>Shiva noticed that Chitraangadh’s ever-beaming face had  lost its smile  for a fraction  of a second as Nandi interrupted  his  flow. But he  recovered  quickly  and  the  smile  returned  to his face once again. Shiva turned and looked at Nandi.</br></br>‘Of course, you may. You don’t need to take my permission,  Nandi,’  said  Shiva.  ‘But in return, you have to promise me something, my friend.’</br></br>‘Of course, Sir,’ replied Nandi bowing slightly.</br></br>‘Call me Shiva. Not Sir,’ grinned Shiva. ‘I am your friend. Not your Chief.’</br></br>A surprised Nandi looked up, bowed again and said, ‘Yes Sir. I mean, yes, Shiva.’</br></br>Shiva  turned  back  to  Chitraangadh,  whose  smile   for  some   reason   appeared   more genuine now. He said, ‘Well Shiva, if you will follow me to the registration desk, we will complete the formalities quickly.’</br></br> </br></br></br></br>The newly registered		tribe reached	the residential	quarters	in the immigration camp, to see  Nandi  waiting  outside  the  main gates;	he led them in. The  roads  of the  camp  were just  like  those of Srinagar.	They  were  laid  out  in a  neat  north-south  and  east-west	grid. The carefully	paved	footpaths	contrasted		sharply		with  the  dirt tracks	in Shiva’s	own land.  He noticed  something		strange	about the road though.</br></br>‘Nandi,   what  are   those  differently  coloured	stones	running   through  the  centre	of the road?’ asked Shiva.</br></br>‘They  cover  the underground	drains,  Shiva.	The  drains   take  all the waste	water of the camp  out. It ensures	that the camp remains clean and hygienic’</br></br>Shiva marvelled	at the almost obsessively	meticulous	planning of the Meluhans.</br></br>The  Gunas  reached  the  large  building  that  had  been  assigned  to  them.  For   the umpteenth time, they  thanked  the wisdom  of their leader  in deciding  to come  to Meluha.  The three—storeyed building  had  comfortable,  separate  living  quarters  for each  family. Each room had  luxurious  furniture  including  a  highly  polished  copper  plate  on the  wall  on which they could  see  their  reflection.  The  rooms  had  clean  linen  bed  sheets,  towels and even some clothes.  Feeling  the  cloth,  a  bewildered  Shiva  asked,  ‘What  is  this material?’</br></br>Chitraangadh replied enthusiastically,  ‘It’s cotton,  Shiva.  The  plant  is grown  in our lands and fashioned into the cloth that you hold.’</br></br>There was a broad picture window on each  wall  to allow  the  light  and  the  warmth  of the sun.  Notches	on  each	wall  supported		a  metal   rod  with a  controlled	flame on top for lighting.   Each   room  had  an  attached	bathroom	with a  sloping	floor that  enabled	the water to flow naturally to a  hole  which  drained  it out.  At the  right  end  of each  bathroom was  a  paved   basin  on  the  ground which culminated	in a large hole. The purpose of this</br></br> 
contraption   was a mystery	to the  tribe.  The  side  walls  had  some   kind  of device,	which when turned, allowed water to flow through.</br></br>‘Magic!’ whispered	Bhadra’s	mother.</br></br>Beside		the  main  door  of the  building  was  an attached	house.	A doctor and her nurses walked  out of the  house  to greet  Shiva.   The  doctor,  a petite,  wheat-skinned	woman was dressed			in a simple white cloth tied around her  waist  and  legs  in a  style  the  Meluhans called	dhoti . A smaller white cloth was tied as a blouse  around  her  chest  while  another cloth called an angvastram	was  draped   over her shoulders.	The centre of her forehead bore  a  white  dot.  Her head  had been  shaved	clean except for a knotted tuft of hair at the back,  called  a  choti  . A loose  string  called a  janau	was tied down from her left shoulder across her torso to the right side.</br></br>Nandi was  genuinely	starded	at seeing	her.  With a reverential	namaste,	he said, ‘Lady Ayurvati! I didn’t expect a doctor of your stature here.’</br></br>Ayurvati looked at Nandi with a smile and a polite namaste. ‘I strongly believe  in  the field-work experience programme, Captain. My team  follows  it strictly.  However,  I am terribly sorry but I didn’t recognise you. Have we met before?’</br></br>‘My name is Captain Nandi, my lady,’ answered Nandi. We haven’t  met  but who doesn’t know you, the greatest doctor in the land?’</br></br>‘Thank you, Captain Nandi,’ said a  visibly  embarrassed  Ayurvati.  ‘But  I  think  you exaggerate. There are many far superior to me.’ Turning quickly towards Shiva, Ayurvati continued, ‘Welcome  to Meluha.  I am  Ayurvati,  your designated  doctor.  My nurses  and  I will be at your assistance for the time that you are in these quarters.’</br></br>Hearing  no reaction	from Shiva,	Chitraangadh		said   in  his most  earnest	voice, ‘These are  just temporary  quarters,	Shiva.   The actual  houses	that will be allocated		to your tribe will  be   much  more  comfortable.		You  have	to  stay	here	only   for the  period	of the quarantine	which will not last more than seven days.’</br></br>‘Oh no, my friend!  The  quarters  are  more  than  comfortable.  They  are  beyond  anything that we  could  have  imagined.  What  say  Mausi?’  grinned  Shiva  at  Bhadra’s  mother, before turning back to Chitraangadh with a frown. ‘But why the quarantine?’</br></br>Nandi cut  in.  ‘Shiva,  the  quarantine  is  just  a  precaution.  We  don’t  have  too  many diseases  in  Meluha.  Sometimes,   immigrants   may  come  in  with  new  diseases.   During this seven—day period, the doctors will observe and cure you of any such ailments.’</br></br>‘And one of the guidelines that you have to follow to control diseases is to maintain strict hygiene standards,’ said Ayurvati.</br></br>Shiva grimaced at Nandi and whispered, ‘Hygiene standards?’</br></br>Nandi’s forehead crinkled into an apologetic frown while his hands  gently  advised acquiescence.  He mumbled,  ‘Please  go along  with it, Shiva.  It is just  one  of those  things that we have to do in Meluha.  Lady  Ayurvati  is considered  to be  the  best  doctor  in the  land.’</br></br>‘If you are free right now, I can give you your instructions,’ said Ayurvati.</br></br>‘I am free right now,’  said  Shiva  with  a  straight  face.  ‘But  I may  have  to charge  you  later.’</br></br>Bhadra giggled softly,  while  Ayurvati  stared  at  Shiva  with  a  blank  face,  clearly  not amused at the pun.</br></br>‘I don’t understand what you’re trying to say,’ said Ayurvati frostily. ‘In any  case,  we will begin at the bathroom.’</br></br>Ayurvati walked into the guest house, muttering under her breath,  ‘These  uncouth immigrants...’</br></br>Shiva raised his eyebrows towards Bhadra, grinning impishly.</br></br> </br></br> 
Late  in the evening,	after  a  hearty  meal,  all  the  Gunas  were  served  a medicinal	drink in their rooms.</br></br>‘Yuck!’ grimaced	Bhadra, his face contorted. ‘This tastes like Yak’s piss!’</br></br>‘How do you  know  what  yak’s piss  tastes	like?’ laughed	Shiva,   as he slapped	his friend hard on the back. ‘Now go to your room. I need to sleep.’</br></br>‘Have  you  seen the beds?	I think this is going to be the best sleep of my life!’</br></br>‘I have  seen  the  bed,  dammit!’  grinned  Shiva.  ‘Now I want to experience	it. Get out!’ Bhadra	left Shiva’s	room,  laughing		loudly.	He  wasn’t		the   only  one  excited		by the unnaturally		soft  beds.	Their  entire	tribe  had	rushed	to  their  rooms		for  what	they anticipated	would   be   the most  comfortable	sleep	of their  lives.	They  were	in for a surprise.</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Shiva	tossed	and   turned   on  his bed  constantly.	He was  wearing	an  orange	coloured dhoti.  The  tiger  skin  had  been   taken   away   to be  washed	— for hygienic	reasons.	His cotton angvastram	was lying on a low chair by the  wall.  A half  lit chillum  lay  forlorn on the side-table.</br></br>This cursed bed is too soft. Impossible to sleep on!</br></br>Shiva  yanked	the  bed  sheet   off the mattress,	tossed	it on the floor and lay down. This was   a  little better.  Sleep		was  stealthily	creeping	in on him. But not as strongly as at home.  He missed	the  rough   cold  floor  of  his  own  hut.  He  missed	the shrill winds of Mount Kailash,		which   broke   through   the most  determined	efforts to ignore them. He missed	the  comforting  stench   of his  tiger  skin.  No doubt,  his current  surroundings	were excessively	comfortable,	but they were unfamiliar and alien.</br></br>As usual, it was his instincts which brought up the truth:</br></br>‘It’s not the room.It’s you.’</br></br>It was  then  that  Shiva   noticed   that  he was  sweating.		Despite   the cool breeze,			he was sweating		profusely.   The room appeared	to be spinning lightly. He felt as if his body was being drawn out of itself. His  frostbitten  right  toe  felt  as  if  it  was  on  fire.  His  battle scarred	left knee  seemed		to be getting  stretched.	His tired  and aching  muscles		felt as if a  great	hand  was   remoulding	them.  His shoulder	bone,  dislocated	in days	past and never completely	healed,	appeared	to be  ripping the muscles	aside so as  to re-engineer the  joint. The muscles	in turn seemed	to be giving way to the bones to do their job.</br></br>Breathing was  an  effort.  He  opened  his  mouth  to help  his  lungs  along.  But  not  enough air flowed  in. Shiva  concentrated   with all his  might,  opened   his  mouth  wide  and  sucked in as much air as he could.  The  curtains  by  the  side  of the  window  rustled  as  a  kindly wind rushed  in.  With the  sudden  gush  of air,  Shiva’s  body  relaxed  just  a  bit. And  then the battle began again. He focused and willed giant gasps of air into his hungry body.</br></br>Knock! Knock!</br></br>The  light  tapping	on  the  door  alerted	Shiva.	He was  disoriented	for a  moment.	Still breathing	hard!  His shoulder	was  twitching.  The  familiar  pain  was  missing.	He looked down  at his  knee.  It didn’t hurt anymore.		The  scar had vanished.		Still gasping	for breath! He  looked   down  at  his  toe.  Whole and  complete	now. He bent to check it. A cracking sound  reverberated		through   the  room  as  his  toe  made   its first movement	in years.	Still breathing  hard!  There  was  also  an  unfamiliar tingling coldness	in his neck. Very cold.</br></br>Knock! Knock! A little more insistent now.</br></br>A bewildered	Shiva  staggered	to his feet,  pulled the  angvastram	around his neck for warmth and opened the door.</br></br>The darkness veiled his face,  but Shiva  could  still recognise  Bhadra.  He whispered  in a  panic stricken  voice,  ‘Shiva,  I’m  sorry  to  disturb  you  so  late.  But  my  mother  has suddenly got a very high fever. What should I do?’</br></br> 
Shiva instinctively touched Bhadra’s forehead. ‘You too have  a fever  Bhadra.  Go to your room. I will get the doctor.’</br></br>As Shiva raced down the corridor towards the steps  he  encountered  many  more  doors opening with the now familiar message. ‘Sudden fever! Help!’</br></br>Shiva sprinted down  the  steps  to the  attached  building  where  the  doctors  were  housed.  He knocked hard on the  door.  Ayurvati  opened  it immediately,  as  if she  was  expecting him. Shiva spoke calmly. ‘Ayurvati, almost my entire tribe has suddenly  fallen  ill. Please come fast, they need help.’</br></br>Ayurvati  touched Shiva’s  forehead.	You don’t have a fever?’ Shiva shook his head. ‘No.’</br></br>Ayurvati  frowned, clearly  surprised.	She   turned  and  ordered  her nurses,	‘Come on. It’s begun. Let’s go.’</br></br>As  Ayurvati   and  her  nurses	rushed	into the  building,	Chitraangadh	appeared	out of nowhere. He asked Shiva, ‘What happened?’</br></br>‘I don’t know. Practically	everybody	in my tribe suddenly	fell ill.’ ‘You too are sweating	heavily’</br></br>‘Don’t worry. I don’t have a fever. Look, I’m going  back  into  the  building.  I want  to see how my people are doing’</br></br>Chitraangadh	nodded, adding, ‘I’ll call Nandi.’</br></br>As Chitraangadh sped away in search of Nandi,  Shiva  ran  into  the  building.  He  was surprised  the  moment  he  entered.  All  the  torches  in  the  building  had  been   lit.  The nurses  were  going  from  room  to  room,  methodically  administering   medicines   and advising the scared patients  on  what  they  should  do.  A scribe  walked  along  with  each nurse meticulously  noting  the  details  of  each  patient  on  a  palm-leaf  booklet.  The Meluhans were clearly prepared for such an eventuality. Ayurvati stood at the end of the corridor, her hands on her  hips.  Like  a  general  supervising  her  superbly  trained  and efficient troops. Shiva rushed up  to  her  and  asked,  ‘What  about  the  second  and  third  floor?’</br></br>Ayurvati answered without turning to him. ‘Nurses  have  already  reached  all  over  the building. I will go up  to supervise  once  the  situation  on  this  floor has  stabilised.  We’ll cover all the patients in the next half hour.’</br></br>‘You people are incredibly efficient but I pray that everyone will be okay,’  said  a worried Shiva.</br></br>Ayurvati turned to look at Shiva. Her eyebrows were raised slightly and a hint of a smile hovered on her serious face.  ‘Don’t worry.  We’re  Meluhans.  We are  capable  of handling  any situation. Everybody will be fine.’</br></br>‘Is there anything I can do to help?’ ‘Yes. Please	go take a bath.’ ‘What?!’</br></br>‘Please go take a bath. Right now,’ said Ayurvati as she turned back to look at her team. ‘Everybody,  please  remember  that  all  children  below  the  age  of  fifteen  must   be  tonsured. Mastrak, please go up and start the secondary medicines.  I’ll be  there  in five minutes.’</br></br>‘Yes, my lady,’ said a young man as he hurried up the steps carrying a large  cloth bag. ‘You’re still here?’ asked Ayurvati as she noticed that Shiva hadn’t left.</br></br>Shiva  spoke  softly,  controlling  his  rising anger,	‘What difference	will my bathing make? My people are in trouble. I want to help.’</br></br>‘I don’t  have   the  time  or the  patience	to argue	with you. You will go take a bath right now!’ said Ayurvati, clearly	not	trying to control her rising temper.</br></br>Shiva glared at Ayurvati  as  he  made  a  heroic  effort to rein  in the  curses  that  wanted  to  leap out of his mouth. His clenched fists wanted to have an argument of their  own  with Ayurvati. But she was a woman.</br></br> 
Ayurvati  too glared   back  at  Shiva.   She  was  used  to being  obeyed.		She was a doctor. If she  told  a  patient   to do something,	she  expected	it to  be  done without question.	But in her  long  years	of experience	she   had  also  seen		a few patients	like Shiva,	especially from the nobility.  Such  patients  had  to be  reasoned			with. Not instructed	. Yet, this  was a simple immigrant. Not some nobleman!</br></br>Controlling herself with great effort, Ayurvati said, ‘Shiva, you  are  sweating.  If you  don’t wash it off, it will kill you. Please  trust me.  You cannot  be of any  help  to your  tribe if you  are dead.’</br></br> </br></br></br></br>Chitraangadh	banged	loudly   on  the  door. A bleary	eyed	Nandi  woke  up cursing.	He wrenched	the door open and growled, ‘This better be important!’</br></br>‘Come quickly. Shiva’s tribe has fallen ill.’</br></br>‘Already?	But this is only  the  first night!’ exclaimed	Nandi.  Picking  up his angvastram	he said, ‘Let’s go!’</br></br>The bathroom  seemed			a strange	place   for a  bath.  Shiva  was  used to splashing	about in the chilly Mansarovar			Lake   for  his bi-monthly  ablutions.	The  bathroom		felt strangely constricted.	He  turned the magical	device   on  the  wall to increase	the flow of water. He used	the  strange	cake-like	substance		that  the  Meluhans	said was a soap to rub  the body clean.		Ayurvati  had  been   very  clear.   The soap		had			to be  used.	He turned the water		off and  picked		up  the   towel.   As  he  rubbed	himself  vigorously,	the mystifying development			he had ignored in the past few hours came flooding  back.  His shoulder  felt better   than  new   He  looked   down  in  awe   at his  knee.		No  pain,  no scar.			He stared	in wonder  at his completely	healed	toe.  And  then he realised		that it wasn’t just the injured parts,		but  his  entire	body  felt  new,	rejuvenated and stronger than ever. His neck, though, still felt intolerably cold.</br></br>What the devil is going on?</br></br>He stepped		out of the bathroom and quickly wore a new dhoti. Again, Ayurvati’s strict instructions	were   not  to  wear   his old clothes	which  were  stained	by his sweat.	As he was  putting  on the angvastram	around his neck for some warmth,  there  was  a  knock  on the  door.  It was Ayurvati.  ‘Shiva,	can   you  open   the door please?		I just want to check whether you are all right.’</br></br>Shiva opened the door.  Ayurvati  stepped  in  and  checked  Shiva’s  temperature;  it was normal. Ayurvati nodded slightly and said, ‘You seem to be healthy. And your tribe  is recovering quickly as well. The trouble has passed.’</br></br>Shiva smiled gratefully. ‘Thanks  to the skills  and  efficiency  of your team.  I am truly sorry  for arguing with you earlier. It was unnecessary. I know you meant well.’</br></br>Ayurvati looked up from her palm-leaf booklet with a slight smile and a raised  eyebrow.  ‘Being polite, are we?’</br></br>‘I’m not that rude, you know,’  grinned  Shiva.  ‘You people  are  just  too supercilious!’ Ayurvati suddenly	stopped   listening   as  she  stared   at  Shiva   with a stunned	look on her face.   How  had  she   not  noticed it before?	She   had never  believed	in the legend.	Was she going to be the first one to see it come true? Pointing  weakly  with  her  hands  she mumbled, ‘Why have you covered your neck?’</br></br>‘It’s very  cold for some  reason.	Is it something	to get worried about?’ asked Shiva as he pulled the angvastram	off.</br></br>A cry resounded loudly through the silent room  as  Ayurvati  staggered  back.  Her  hand covered  her  mouth  in  shock  while  the  palm  leaves  scattered   on  the  floor.  Her  knees were too weak to hold her up. She collapsed  with her  back  against  the  wall,  never  once taking her eyes off Shiva. Tears broke through her proud eyes. She kept repeating, ‘Om Brahmaye namah. Om Brahmaye namah.’</br></br> 
‘What happened?	Is it serious?’	asked a worried Shiva. You have come! My Lord, you have come!’</br></br>Before  a bewildered	Shiva	could   react   to her  strange	reaction,	Nandi  rushed	in and noticed Ayurvati on the ground. Copious tears were flowing down her face.</br></br>‘What happened,	my lady?’ asked a startled Nandi.</br></br>Ayurvati	just  pointed	at  Shiva’s	neck.	Nandi  looked	up.  The  neck	shone	an eerie iridescent		blue.  With  a  cry that sounded		like  that  of a long caged	animal just released from captivity,  Nandi collapsed	on his knees.	‘My Lord! You have come! The Neelkanth has come!’</br></br>The Captain bent low and  brought  his  head  down  to  touch  the  Neelkanth’s  feet reverentially.  The  object  of  his  adoration  however,  stepped  back,  befuddled   and perturbed.</br></br>‘What the hell is going on here?’ Shiva asked agitatedly.</br></br>Holding a hand to his freezing neck, he  turned  around  to the  polished  copper  plate  and stared in stunned astonishment at the reflection of his neel kanth ; his blue throat .</br></br>Chitraangadh, holding the door frame  for support,  sobbed  like  a  child.  ‘We’re  saved!  We’re saved! He has come!’</br></br>
