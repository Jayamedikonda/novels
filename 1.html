          </br>
          1900 BC, Mansarovar Lake(At the foot of Mount Kailash, Tibet)</br>
          Shiva gazed at the orange sky. The clouds hovering above Mansarovar had just parted</br>
          to reveal the setting sun. The brilliant giver of life was calling it a day once again. Shiva</br>
          had seen a few sunrises in his twenty-one years. But the sunset! He tried never to miss</br>
          the sunset! On any other day, Shiva would have taken in the vista — the sun and the</br>
          immense lake against the magnificent backdrop of the Himalayas stretching as far back</br>
          as the eye could see. But not today.</br>
          He squatted and perched his lithe, muscular body on the narrow ledge extending over</br>
          the lake. The numerous batde-scars on his skin gleamed in the shimmering reflected</br>
          light of the waters. Shiva remembered well his carefree childhood days. He had</br>
          perfected the art of throwing pebbles that bounced off the surface of the lake. He still</br>
          held the record in his tribe for the highest number of bounces: seventeen.</br>
          On a normal day, Shiva would have smiled at the memory from a cheerful past that had</br>
          been overwhelmed by the angst of the present. But today, he turned back towards his</br>
          village without any hint of joy.</br>
          Bhadra was alert, guarding the main entrance. Shiva gestured with his eyes. Bhadra</br>
          turned back to find his two back-up soldiers dozing against the fence. He cursed and</br>
          kicked them hard.</br>
          Shiva turned back towards the lake.</br>
          God bless Bhadra! At least he takes some responsibility.</br>
          Shiva brought the chillum made of yak-bone to his hps and took in a deep drag. Any</br>
          other day, the marijuana would have spread its munificence, dulling his troubled mind</br>
          and letting him find some moments of solace. But not today.</br>
          He looked left, at the edge of the lake where the soldiers of the strange foreign visitor</br>
          were kept under guard. With the lake behind them and twenty of Shiva’s own soldiers</br>
          guarding them, it was impossible for them to mount any surprise attack.</br>
          They let themselves be disarmed so easily. They aren’t like the bloodthirsty idiots in our</br>
          land who are looking for any excuse to fight.</br>
          The foreigner’s words came flooding back to Shiva. ‘Come to our land. It lies beyond the</br>
          great mountains. Others call it Meluha. I call it Heaven. It is the richest and most</br>
          powerful empire in India. Indeed the richest and most powerful in the whole world. Our</br>
          government has an offer for immigrants. You will be given fertile land and resources for</br>
          farming. Today, your tribe, the Gunas, fight for survival in this rough, arid land. Meluha</br>
          offers you a lifestyle beyond your wildest dreams. We ask for nothing in return. Just live</br>
          in peace, pay your taxes and follow the laws of the land.’</br>
          Shiva mused that he would certainly not be a chief in this new land.</br>
          Would I really miss that so much?</br>
          His tribe would have to live by the laws of the foreigners. They would have to work</br>
          every day for a living.</br>
          That’s better than fighting every day just to stay alive!</br>
          Shiva took another puff from his chillum. As the smoke cleared, he turned to stare at the</br>
          hut in the centre of his village, right next to his own, where the foreigner had been</br>
          stationed. He had been told that he could sleep there in comfort. In fact, Shiva wanted</br>
          to keep him host age. Just in case.</br>
          We fight almost every month with the Pakratis just so that our village can exist next to</br>
          the holy lake. They are getting stronger every year, forming new alliances with new</br>
          tribes. We can beat the Pakratis, but not all the mountain tribes together! By moving to</br>
          Meluha, we can escape this pointless violence and may be live a life of comfort. What</br>
          could possibly be wrong with that? Why shouldn’t we take this deal? It sounds so damn</br>
          good!</br>
          Shiva took one last drag from the chillum before banging it on the rock, letting the ash</br>
          slip out and rose quickly from his perch. Brushing a few specks of ash from his bare</br>
          chest, he wiped his hands on his tiger skin skirt, rapidly striding to his village. Bhadra</br>
          and his back-up stood to attention as Shiva passed the gate. Shiva frowned and</br>
          gestured for Bhadra to ease up.</br>
          Why does he keep forgetting that he has been my closestfriend since childhood? My</br>
          becoming the chief hasn’t really changed anything. He doesn’t need to behave</br>
          unnecessarily servile in front of others.</br>
          The huts in Shiva’s village were luxurious compared to others in their land. A grown</br>
          man could actually stand upright in them. The shelter could withstand the harsh</br>
          mountain winds for nearly three years before surrendering to the elements. He flung the</br>
          empty chillum into his hut as he strode to the hut where the visitor lay sleeping soundly.</br>
          Either he doesn’t realise he is a hostage. Or he genuinely believes that good behaviour</br>
          begets good behaviour.</br>
          Shiva remembered what his uncle, also his Guru, used to say. ‘People do what their</br>
          society rewards them to do. If the society rewards trust, people will be trusting.’</br>
          Meluha must he a trusting society if it teaches even its soldiers to expect the best in</br>
          strangers.</br>
          Shiva scratched his shaggy beard as he stared hard at the visitor.</br>
          He had said his name was Nandi.</br>
          The Meluhan’s massive proportions appeared even more enormous as he sprawled on</br>
          the floor in his stupor, his immense belly jiggling with every breath. Despite being</br>
          obese, his skin was taut and toned. His child-like face looked even more innocent</br>
          asleep, with his mouth half open.</br>
          Is this the man who will lead me to my destiny? Do I really have the destiny my uncle</br>
          spoke of?</br>
          ‘Your destiny is much larger than these massive mountains. But to make it come true,</br>
          you will have to cross these very same massive mountains.’</br>
          Do I deserve a good destiny? My people come first. Will they be happy in Meluha?</br>
          Shiva continued to stare at the sleeping Nandi. Then he heard the sound of a conch</br>
          shell.</br>
          Pakratis!</br>
          ‘POSITIONS!’ screamed Shiva, as he drew his sword.</br>
          Nandi was up in an instant, drawing a hidden sword from his fur coat kept to the side.</br>
          They sprinted to the village gates. Following standard protocol, the women started</br>
          rushing to the village centre, carrying their children along. The men ran the other way,</br>
          swords drawn.</br>
          ‘Bhadra! Our soldiers at the lake!’ shouted Shiva as he reached the entrance.</br>
          Bhadra relayed the orders and the Guna soldiers obeyed instantly. They were surprised</br>
          to see the Meluhans draw weapons hidden in their coats and rush to the village. The</br>
          Pakratis were upon them within moments.</br>
          It was a well-planned ambush by the Pakratis. Dusk was usually a time when the Guna</br>
          soldiers took time to thank their gods for a day without battle. The women did their</br>
          chores by the lakeside. If there was a time of weakness for the formidable Gunas, a</br>
          time when they weren’t a fearsome martial clan, but just another mountain tribe trying to</br>
          survive in a tough, hostile land, this was it.</br>
          But fate was against the Pakratis yet again. Thanks to the foreign presence, Shiva had</br>
          ordered the Gunas to remain alert. Thus they were forewarned and the Pakratis lost the</br>
          element of surprise. The presence of the Meluhans was also decisive, turning the tide of</br>
          the short, brutal battle in favour of the Gunas. The Pakratis had to retreat.</br>
          Bloodied and scarred, Shiva surveyed the damage at the end of the battle. Two Guna</br>
          soldiers had succumbed to their injuries. They would be honoured as clan heroes. But</br>
          even worse, the warning had come too late for at least ten Guna women and children.</br>
          Their mutilated bodies were found next to the lake. The losses were high.</br>
          Bastards They kill women and children when they can’t beat us!</br>
          A livid Shiva called the entire tribe to the centre of the village. His mind was made.</br>
          ‘This land is fit for barbarians! We have fought pointless battles with no end in sight. You</br>
          know my uncle tried to make peace, even offering access to the lake shore to the</br>
          mountain tribes. But these scum mistook our desire for peace as weakness. We all</br>
          know what followed!’</br>
          The Gunas, despite being used to the brutality of regular battle, were shell-shocked by</br>
          the viciousness of the attack on the women and children.</br>
          ‘I keep nothing secret from you. All of you know the invitation of the foreigners,’</br>
          continued Shiva, pointing to Nandi and the Meluhans. ‘They fought shoulder-to-shoulder</br>
          with us today. They have earned my trust. I want to go with them to Meluha. But this</br>
          cannot be my decision alone.’</br>
          ‘You are our chief, Shiva,’ said Bhadra. ‘Your decision is our decision. That is the</br>
          tradition.’</br>
          ‘Not this time,’ said Shiva holding out his hand. ‘This will change our lives completely. I</br>
          believe the change will be for the better. Anything will be better than the pointlessness</br>
          of the violence we face daily. I have told you what I want to do. But the choice to go or</br>
          not is yours. Let the Gunas speak. This time, I follow you.’</br>
          The Gunas were clear on their tradition. But the respect for Shiva was not just based on</br>
          convention, but also on his character. He had led the Gunas to their greatest military</br>
          victories through his genius and sheer personal bravery.</br>
          They spoke in one voice. ‘Your decision is our decision.’</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          It had been five days since Shiva had uprooted his tribe. The caravan had camped in a</br>
          nook at the base of one of the great valleys dotting the route to Meluha. Shiva had</br>
          organized the camp in three concentric circles. The yaks had been tied around the</br>
          outermost circle, to act as an alarm in case of any intruders. The men were stationed in</br>
          the intermediate ring to fight if there was a battle. And the women and children were in</br>
          the innermost circle, just around the fire. Expendable first, defenders second and the</br>
          most vulnerable at the inside.</br>
          Shiva was prepared for the worst. He believed that there would be an ambush. It was</br>
          only a matter of time.</br>
          The Pakratis should have been delighted to have access to the prime lands, as well as</br>
          free occupation of the lake front. But Shiva knew that Yakhya, the Pakrati chief, would</br>
          not allow them to leave peacefully. Yakhya would like nothing better than to become a</br>
          legend by claiming that he had defeated Shiva’s Gunas and won the land for the</br>
          Pakratis. It was precisely this weird tribal logic that Shiva detested. In an atmosphere</br>
          like this, there was never any hope for peace.</br>
          Shiva relished the call of battle, revelled in its art. But he also knew that ultimately, the</br>
          battles in his land were an exercise in futility.</br>
          He turned to an alert Nandi sitting some distance away. The twenty-five Meluhan</br>
          soldiers were seated in an arc around a second camp circle.</br>
          Why did he pick the Gunas to immigrate? Why not the Pakratis?</br>
          Shiva’s thoughts were broken as he saw a shadow move in the distance. He stared</br>
          hard, but everything was still. Sometimes the light played tricks in this part of the world.</br>
          Shiva relaxed his stance.</br>
          And then he saw the shadow again.</br>
          ‘TO ARMS!’ screamed Shiva.</br>
          The Gunas and Meluhans drew their weapons and took up battle positions as fifty</br>
          Pakratis charged in. The stupidity of rushing in without thought hit them hard as they</br>
          met with a wall of panicky animals. The yaks bucked and kicked uncontrollably, injuring</br>
          many Pakratis before they could even begin their skirmish. A few slipped through. And</br>
          weapons clashed.</br>
          A young Pakrati, obviously a novice, charged at Shiva, swinging wildly. Shiva stepped</br>
          back, avoiding the strike. He brought his sword back up in a smooth arc, inflicting a</br>
          superficial cut on the Pakrati’s chest. The young warrior cursed and swung back,</br>
          opening his flank. That was all Shiva needed. He pushed his sword in brutally, cutting</br>
          through the gut of his enemy. Almost instantly, he pulled the blade out, twisting it as he</br>
          did, and left the Pakrati to a slow, painful death. Shiva turned around to find a Pakrati</br>
          ready to strike a Guna. He jumped high and swung from the elevation slicing neatly</br>
          through the Pakrati’s sword arm, severing it.</br>
          Meanwhile Bhadra, as adept at the art of battle as Shiva, was fighting two Pakratis</br>
          simultaneously, with a sword in each hand. His hump did not seem to impeded his</br>
          movements as he transferred his weight easily, striking the Pakrati on his left on his</br>
          throat. Leaving him to die slowly, he swung with his right hand, cutting across the face</br>
          of the other soldier, gouging his eye out. As the soldier fell, Bhadra brought his left</br>
          sword down brutally, ending the suffering quickly for this hapless enemy.</br>
          The battle at the Meluhan end of camp was very different. They were exceptionally well-</br>
          trained soldiers. But they were not vicious. They were following rules, avoiding killing, as</br>
          far as possible.</br>
          Outnumbered and led poorly, it was but a short while before the Pakratis were beaten.</br>
          Almost half of them lay dead and the rest were on their knees, begging for mercy.</br>
          One of them was Yakhya, his shoulder cut deep by Nandi, debilitating the movement of</br>
          his sword arm.</br>
          Bhadra stood behind the Pakrati chief, his sword raised high, ready to strike. ‘Shiva,</br>
          quick and easy or slow and painful?’</br>
          ‘Sir!’ intervened Nandi, before Shiva could speak. Shiva turned towards the Meluhan.</br>
          ‘This is wrong! They are begging for mercy! Killing them is against the rules of war.’</br>
          ‘You don’t know the Pakratis!’ said Shiva. ‘They are brutal. They will keep attacking us</br>
          even if there is nothing to gain. This has to end. Once and for all.’</br>
          ‘It is already ending. You are not going to live here anymore. You will soon be in</br>
          Meluha.’</br>
          Shiva stood silent.</br>
          Nandi continued, ‘How you want to end this is up to you. More of the same or different?’</br>
          Bhadra looked at Shiva. Waiting.</br>
          ‘You can show the Pakratis that you are better,’ said Nandi. Shiva turned towards the</br>
          horizon, seeing the massive mountains.</br>
          Destiny? Chance of a better life?</br>
          He turned back to Bhadra. ‘Disarm them. Take all their provisions. Release them.’</br>
          Even if the Pakratis are mad enough to go back to their village, rearm and come back,</br>
          we would be long gone.</br>
          A shocked Bhadra stared at Shiva. But immediately started implementing the order.</br>
          Nandi gazed at Shiva with hope. There was but one thought that reverberated through</br>
          his mind. ‘Shiva has the heart. He has the potential. Please, let it be him. I pray to you</br>
          Lord Ram, let it be him.’</br>
          Shiva walked back to the young soldier he had stabbed. He lay writhing on the ground,</br>
          face contorted in pain, as blood oozed slowly out of his guts. For this first time in his life,</br>
          Shiva felt pity for a Pakrati. He drew his sword and ended the young soldier’s suffering.</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          After marching continuously for four weeks, the caravan of invited immigrants crested</br>
          the final mountain to reach the outskirts of Srinagar, the capital of the valley of Kashmir.</br>
          Nandi had talked excitedly about the glories of his perfect land. Shiva had prepared</br>
          himself to see some incredible sights, which he could not have imagined in his simple</br>
          homeland. But nothing could have primed him for the sheer spectacle of what certainly</br>
          was paradise. Meluha . The land of pure life!</br>
          The mighty Jhelum river, a roaring tigress in the mountains, slowed down to the beat of</br>
          a languorous cow as she entered the valley. She caressed the heavenly land of</br>
          Kashmir, meandering her way into the immense Dal Lake. Further down, she broke</br>
          away from the lake, continuing her journey to the sea.</br>
          The vast valley was covered by a lush green canvas of grass. On it was painted the</br>
          masterpiece that was Kashmir. Rows upon rows of flowers arrayed all of God’s colours,</br>
          their brilliance broken only by the soaring Chinar trees, offering a majestic, yet warm</br>
          Kashmiri welcome. The melodious singing of the birds calmed the exhausted ears of</br>
          Shiva’s tribe, accustomed only to the rude howling of icy mountain winds.</br>
          ‘If this is the border province, how perfect must the rest of the country be?’ whispered</br>
          Shiva in awe.</br>
          The Dal Lake was the site of an ancient army camp of the Meluhans. Upon the western</br>
          banks of the lake, by the side of the Jhelum lay the frontier town that had grown beyond</br>
          its simple encampments into the grand Srinagar . Literally, the ‘respected     city’ .</br>
          Srinagar had been raised upon a massive platform of almost a hundred hectares in</br>
          size. The platform built of earth, towered almost five metres high. On top of the platform</br>
          were the city walls, which were another twenty metres in height and four metres thick.</br>
          The simplicity and brilliance of building an entire city on a platform astounded the</br>
          Gunas. It was a strong protection against enemies who would have to fight up a fort wall</br>
          which was essentially solid ground. The platform served another vital purpose: it raised</br>
          the ground level of the city, an extremely effective strategy against the recurrent floods</br>
          in this land. Inside the fort walls, the city was divided into blocks by roads laid out in a</br>
          neat grid pattern. It had specially constructed market areas, temples, gardens, meeting</br>
          halls and everything else that would be required for sophisticated urban living. All the</br>
          houses looked like simple multiple-storeyed block structures from the outside. The only</br>
          way to differentiate a rich man’s house was that his block would be bigger.</br>
          In contrast to the extravagant natural landscape of Kashmir, the city of Srinagar itself</br>
          was painted only in restrained greys, blues and whites. The entire city was a picture of</br>
          cleanliness, order and sobriety. Nearly twenty thousand souls called Srinagar their</br>
          home. Now an additional two hundred had just arrived from Mount Kailash. And their</br>
          leader felt a lightness of being he hadn’t experienced since that terrible day, many years</br>
          ago.</br>
          I have escaped. I can make a new beginning. I can forget.</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          The caravan travelled to the immigrant camp outside Srinagar. The camp had been built</br>
          on a separate platform on the southern side of the city. Nandi led Shiva and his tribe to</br>
          the Foreigners’ Office, which was placed just outside the camp. Nandi requested Shiva</br>
          to wait outside as he went into the office. He soon returned, accompanied by a young</br>
          official. The official gave a practised smile and folded his hands in a formal namaste.</br>
          ‘Welcome to Meluha. I am Chitraangadh. I will be your Orientation Executive. Think of</br>
          me as your single point of contact for all issues whilst you are here. I believe your</br>
          leader’s name is Shiva. Will he step up please?’</br>
          Shiva took a step forward. ‘I am Shiva.’</br>
          ‘Excellent,’ said Chitraangadh. ‘Would you be so kind as to follow me to the registration</br>
          desk please? You will be registered as the caretaker of your tribe. Any communication</br>
          that concerns them will go through you. Since you are the designated leader, the</br>
          implementation of all directives within your tribe would be your responsibility’</br>
          Nandi cut into Chitraangadh’s officious speech to tell Shiva, ‘Sir, if you will just excuse</br>
          me, I will go to the immigrant camp quarters and arrange the temporary living</br>
          arrangements for your tribe.’</br>
          Shiva noticed that Chitraangadh’s ever-beaming face had lost its smile for a fraction of a</br>
          second as Nandi interrupted his flow. But he recovered quickly and the smile returned to</br>
          his face once again. Shiva turned and looked at Nandi.</br>
          ‘Of course, you may. You don’t need to take my permission, Nandi,’ said Shiva. ‘But in</br>
          return, you have to promise me something, my friend.’</br>
          ‘Of course, Sir,’ replied Nandi bowing slightly.</br>
          ‘Call me Shiva. Not Sir,’ grinned Shiva. ‘I am your friend. Not your Chief.’</br>
          A surprised Nandi looked up, bowed again and said, ‘Yes Sir. I mean, yes, Shiva.’</br>
          Shiva turned back to Chitraangadh, whose smile for some reason appeared more</br>
          genuine now. He said, ‘Well Shiva, if you will follow me to the registration desk, we will</br>
          complete the formalities quickly.’</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          The newly registered tribe reached the residential quarters in the immigration camp, to</br>
          see Nandi waiting outside the main gates; he led them in. The roads of the camp were</br>
          just like those of Srinagar. They were laid out in a neat north-south and east-west grid.</br>
          The carefully paved footpaths contrasted sharply with the dirt tracks in Shiva’s own</br>
          land. He noticed something strange about the road though.</br>
          ‘Nandi, what are those differently coloured stones running through the centre of the</br>
          road?’ asked Shiva.</br>
          ‘They cover the underground drains, Shiva. The drains take all the waste water of the</br>
          camp out. It ensures that the camp remains clean and hygienic’</br>
          Shiva marvelled at the almost obsessively meticulous planning of the Meluhans.</br>
          The Gunas reached the large building that had been assigned to them. For the</br>
          umpteenth time, they thanked the wisdom of their leader in deciding to come to Meluha.</br>
          The three—storeyed building had comfortable, separate living quarters for each family.</br>
          Each room had luxurious furniture including a highly polished copper plate on the wall</br>
          on which they could see their reflection. The rooms had clean linen bed sheets, towels</br>
          and even some clothes. Feeling the cloth, a bewildered Shiva asked, ‘What is this</br>
          material?’</br>
          Chitraangadh replied enthusiastically, ‘It’s cotton, Shiva. The plant is grown in our lands</br>
          and fashioned into the cloth that you hold.’</br>
          There was a broad picture window on each wall to allow the light and the warmth of the</br>
          sun. Notches on each wall supported a metal rod with a controlled flame on top for</br>
          lighting. Each room had an attached bathroom with a sloping floor that enabled the</br>
          water to flow naturally to a hole which drained it out. At the right end of each bathroom</br>
          was a paved basin on the ground which culminated in a large hole. The purpose of this</br>
          contraption was a mystery to the tribe. The side walls had some kind of device, which</br>
          when turned, allowed water to flow through.</br>
          ‘Magic!’ whispered Bhadra’s mother.</br>
          Beside the main door of the building was an attached house. A doctor and her nurses</br>
          walked out of the house to greet Shiva. The doctor, a petite, wheat-skinned woman was</br>
          dressed in a simple white cloth tied around her waist and legs in a style the Meluhans</br>
          called dhoti . A smaller white cloth was tied as a blouse around her chest while another</br>
          cloth called an angvastram       was draped over her shoulders. The centre of her forehead</br>
          bore a white dot. Her head had been shaved clean except for a knotted tuft of hair at the</br>
          back, called a choti . A loose string called a janau was tied down from her left shoulder</br>
          across her torso to the right side.</br>
          Nandi was genuinely starded at seeing her. With a reverential namaste, he said, ‘Lady</br>
          Ayurvati! I didn’t expect a doctor of your stature here.’</br>
          Ayurvati looked at Nandi with a smile and a polite namaste. ‘I strongly believe in the</br>
          field-work experience programme, Captain. My team follows it strictly. However, I am</br>
          terribly sorry but I didn’t recognise you. Have we met before?’</br>
          ‘My name is Captain Nandi, my lady,’ answered Nandi. We haven’t met but who doesn’t</br>
          know you, the greatest doctor in the land?’</br>
          ‘Thank you, Captain Nandi,’ said a visibly embarrassed             Ayurvati. ‘But I think you</br>
          exaggerate. There are many far superior to me.’ Turning quickly towards Shiva, Ayurvati</br>
          continued, ‘Welcome to Meluha. I am Ayurvati, your designated doctor. My nurses and I</br>
          will be at your assistance for the time that you are in these quarters.’</br>
          Hearing no reaction from Shiva, Chitraangadh said in his most earnest voice, ‘These</br>
          are just temporary quarters, Shiva. The actual houses that will be allocated to your tribe</br>
          will be much more comfortable. You have to stay here only for the period of the</br>
          quarantine which will not last more than seven days.’</br>
          ‘Oh no, my friend! The quarters are more than comfortable. They are beyond anything</br>
          that we could have imagined. What say Mausi?’             grinned Shiva at Bhadra’s mother,</br>
          before turning back to Chitraangadh with a frown. ‘But why the quarantine?’</br>
          Nandi cut in. ‘Shiva, the quarantine is just a precaution. We don’t have too many</br>
          diseases in Meluha. Sometimes, immigrants may come in with new diseases. During</br>
          this seven—day period, the doctors will observe and cure you of any such ailments.’</br>
          ‘And one of the guidelines that you have to follow to control diseases is to maintain strict</br>
          hygiene standards,’ said Ayurvati.</br>
          Shiva grimaced at Nandi and whispered, ‘Hygiene standards?’</br>
          Nandi’s forehead crinkled into an apologetic frown while his hands gently advised</br>
          acquiescence. He mumbled, ‘Please go along with it, Shiva. It is just one of those things</br>
          that we have to do in Meluha. Lady Ayurvati is considered to be the best doctor in the</br>
          land.’</br>
          ‘If you are free right now, I can give you your instructions,’ said Ayurvati.</br>
          ‘I am free right now,’ said Shiva with a straight face. ‘But I may have to charge you</br>
          later.’</br>
          Bhadra giggled softly, while Ayurvati stared at Shiva with a blank face, clearly not</br>
          amused at the pun.</br>
          ‘I don’t understand what you’re trying to say,’ said Ayurvati frostily. ‘In any case, we will</br>
          begin at the bathroom.’</br>
          Ayurvati walked into the guest house, muttering under her breath, ‘These uncouth</br>
          immigrants...’</br>
          Shiva raised his eyebrows towards Bhadra, grinning impishly.</br>
          Late in the evening, after a hearty meal, all the Gunas were served a medicinal drink in</br>
          their rooms.</br>
          ‘Yuck!’ grimaced Bhadra, his face contorted. ‘This tastes like Yak’s piss!’</br>
          ‘How do you know what yak’s piss tastes like?’ laughed Shiva, as he slapped his friend</br>
          hard on the back. ‘Now go to your room. I need to sleep.’</br>
          ‘Have you seen the beds? I think this is going to be the best sleep of my life!’</br>
          ‘I have seen the bed, dammit!’ grinned Shiva. ‘Now I want to experience it. Get out!’</br>
          Bhadra left Shiva’s room, laughing loudly. He wasn’t the only one excited by the</br>
          unnaturally soft beds. Their entire tribe had rushed to their rooms for what they</br>
          anticipated would be the most comfortable sleep of their lives. They were in for a</br>
          surprise.</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          Shiva tossed and turned on his bed constantly. He was wearing an orange coloured</br>
          dhoti. The tiger skin had been taken away to be washed — for hygienic reasons. His</br>
          cotton angvastram was lying on a low chair by the wall. A half lit chillum lay forlorn on</br>
          the side-table.</br>
          This cursed bed is too soft. Impossible to sleep on!</br>
          Shiva yanked the bed sheet off the mattress, tossed it on the floor and lay down. This</br>
          was a little better. Sleep was stealthily creeping in on him. But not as strongly as at</br>
          home. He missed the rough cold floor of his own hut. He missed the shrill winds of</br>
          Mount Kailash, which broke through the most determined efforts to ignore them. He</br>
          missed the comforting stench of his tiger skin. No doubt, his current surroundings were</br>
          excessively comfortable, but they were unfamiliar and alien.</br>
          As usual, it was his instincts which brought up the truth:</br>
          ‘It’s not the room.It’s you.’</br>
          It was then that Shiva noticed that he was sweating. Despite the cool breeze, he was</br>
          sweating profusely. The room appeared to be spinning lightly. He felt as if his body was</br>
          being drawn out of itself. His frostbitten right toe felt as if it was on fire. His battle</br>
          scarred left knee seemed to be getting stretched. His tired and aching muscles felt as if</br>
          a great hand was remoulding them. His shoulder bone, dislocated in days past and</br>
          never completely healed, appeared to be ripping the muscles aside so as to re-engineer</br>
          the joint. The muscles in turn seemed to be giving way to the bones to do their job.</br>
          Breathing was an effort. He opened his mouth to help his lungs along. But not enough</br>
          air flowed in. Shiva concentrated with all his might, opened his mouth wide and sucked</br>
          in as much air as he could. The curtains by the side of the window rustled as a kindly</br>
          wind rushed in. With the sudden gush of air, Shiva’s body relaxed just a bit. And then</br>
          the battle began again. He focused and willed giant gasps of air into his hungry body.</br>
          Knock! Knock!</br>
          The light tapping on the door alerted Shiva. He was disoriented for a moment. Still</br>
          breathing hard! His shoulder was twitching. The familiar pain was missing. He looked</br>
          down at his knee. It didn’t hurt anymore. The scar had vanished. Still gasping for breath!</br>
          He looked down at his toe. Whole and complete now. He bent to check it. A cracking</br>
          sound reverberated through the room as his toe made its first movement in years. Still</br>
          breathing hard! There was also an unfamiliar tingling coldness in his neck. Very cold.</br>
          Knock! Knock! A little more insistent now.</br>
          A bewildered Shiva staggered to his feet, pulled the angvastram around his neck for</br>
          warmth and opened the door.</br>
          The darkness veiled his face, but Shiva could still recognise Bhadra. He whispered in a</br>
          panic stricken voice, ‘Shiva, I’m sorry to disturb you so late. But my mother has</br>
          suddenly got a very high fever. What should I do?’</br>
          Shiva instinctively touched Bhadra’s forehead. ‘You too have a fever Bhadra. Go to your</br>
          room. I will get the doctor.’</br>
          As Shiva raced down the corridor towards the steps he encountered many more doors</br>
          opening with the now familiar message. ‘Sudden fever! Help!’</br>
          Shiva sprinted down the steps to the attached building where the doctors were housed.</br>
          He knocked hard on the door. Ayurvati opened it immediately, as if she was expecting</br>
          him. Shiva spoke calmly. ‘Ayurvati, almost my entire tribe has suddenly fallen ill. Please</br>
          come fast, they need help.’</br>
          Ayurvati touched Shiva’s forehead. You don’t have a fever?’</br>
          Shiva shook his head. ‘No.’</br>
          Ayurvati frowned, clearly surprised. She turned and ordered her nurses, ‘Come on. It’s</br>
          begun. Let’s go.’</br>
          As Ayurvati and her nurses rushed into the building, Chitraangadh appeared out of</br>
          nowhere. He asked Shiva, ‘What happened?’</br>
          ‘I don’t know. Practically everybody in my tribe suddenly fell ill.’</br>
          ‘You too are sweating heavily’</br>
          ‘Don’t worry. I don’t have a fever. Look, I’m going back into the building. I want to see</br>
          how my people are doing’</br>
          Chitraangadh nodded, adding, ‘I’ll call Nandi.’</br>
          As Chitraangadh sped away in search of Nandi, Shiva ran into the building. He was</br>
          surprised the moment he entered. All the torches in the building had been lit. The</br>
          nurses were going from room to room, methodically administering medicines and</br>
          advising the scared patients on what they should do. A scribe walked along with each</br>
          nurse meticulously noting the details of each patient on a palm-leaf booklet. The</br>
          Meluhans were clearly prepared for such an eventuality. Ayurvati stood at the end of the</br>
          corridor, her hands on her hips. Like a general supervising her superbly trained and</br>
          efficient troops. Shiva rushed up to her and asked, ‘What about the second and third</br>
          floor?’</br>
          Ayurvati answered without turning to him. ‘Nurses have already reached all over the</br>
          building. I will go up to supervise once the situation on this floor has stabilised. We’ll</br>
          cover all the patients in the next half hour.’</br>
          ‘You people are incredibly efficient but I pray that everyone will be okay,’ said a worried</br>
          Shiva.</br>
          Ayurvati turned to look at Shiva. Her eyebrows were raised slightly and a hint of a smile</br>
          hovered on her serious face. ‘Don’t worry. We’re Meluhans. We are capable of handling</br>
          any situation. Everybody will be fine.’</br>
          ‘Is there anything I can do to help?’</br>
          ‘Yes. Please go take a bath.’</br>
          ‘What?!’</br>
          ‘Please go take a bath. Right now,’ said Ayurvati as she turned back to look at her team.</br>
          ‘Everybody, please remember that all children below the age of fifteen must              be</br>
          tonsured. Mastrak, please go up and start the secondary medicines. I’ll be there in five</br>
          minutes.’</br>
          ‘Yes, my lady,’ said a young man as he hurried up the steps carrying a large cloth bag.</br>
          ‘You’re still here?’ asked Ayurvati as she noticed that Shiva hadn’t left.</br>
          Shiva spoke softly, controlling his rising anger, ‘What difference will my bathing make?</br>
          My people are in trouble. I want to help.’</br>
          ‘I don’t have the time or the patience to argue with you. You will go take a bath right</br>
          now!’ said Ayurvati, clearly not trying to control her rising temper.</br>
          Shiva glared at Ayurvati as he made a heroic effort to rein in the curses that wanted to</br>
          leap out of his mouth. His clenched fists wanted to have an argument of their own with</br>
          Ayurvati. But she was a woman.</br>
          Ayurvati too glared back at Shiva. She was used to being obeyed. She was a doctor. If</br>
          she told a patient to do something, she expected it to be done without question. But in</br>
          her long years of experience she had also seen a few patients like Shiva, especially</br>
          from the nobility. Such patients had to be reasoned       with. Not instructed . Yet, this was</br>
          a simple immigrant. Not some nobleman!</br>
          Controlling herself with great effort, Ayurvati said, ‘Shiva, you are sweating. If you don’t</br>
          wash it off, it will kill you. Please trust me. You cannot be of any help to your tribe if you</br>
          are dead.’</br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          Chitraangadh banged loudly on the door. A bleary eyed Nandi woke up cursing. He</br>
          wrenched the door open and growled, ‘This better be important!’</br>
          ‘Come quickly. Shiva’s tribe has fallen ill.’</br>
          ‘Already? But this is only the first night!’ exclaimed Nandi. Picking up his angvastram he</br>
          said, ‘Let’s go!’</br>
          The bathroom seemed a strange place for a bath. Shiva was used to splashing about in</br>
          the chilly Mansarovar Lake for his bi-monthly ablutions. The bathroom felt strangely</br>
          constricted. He turned the magical device on the wall to increase the flow of water. He</br>
          used the strange cake-like substance that the Meluhans said was a soap to rub the</br>
          body clean. Ayurvati had been very clear. The soap had to be used. He turned the</br>
          water off and picked up the towel. As he rubbed himself vigorously, the mystifying</br>
          development he had ignored in the past few hours came flooding back. His shoulder felt</br>
          better than new He looked down in awe at his knee. No pain, no scar. He stared in</br>
          wonder at his completely healed toe. And then he realised that it wasn’t just the injured</br>
          parts, but his entire body felt new, rejuvenated and stronger than ever. His neck,</br>
          though, still felt intolerably cold.</br>
          What the devil is going on?</br>
          He stepped out of the bathroom and quickly wore a new dhoti. Again, Ayurvati’s strict</br>
          instructions were not to wear his old clothes which were stained by his sweat. As he</br>
          was putting on the angvastram around his neck for some warmth, there was a knock on</br>
          the door. It was Ayurvati. ‘Shiva, can you open the door please? I just want to check</br>
          whether you are all right.’</br>
          Shiva opened the door. Ayurvati stepped in and checked Shiva’s temperature; it was</br>
          normal. Ayurvati nodded slightly and said, ‘You seem to be healthy. And your tribe is</br>
          recovering quickly as well. The trouble has passed.’</br>
          Shiva smiled gratefully. ‘Thanks to the skills and efficiency of your team. I am truly sorry</br>
          for arguing with you earlier. It was unnecessary. I know you meant well.’</br>
          Ayurvati looked up from her palm-leaf booklet with a slight smile and a raised eyebrow.</br>
          ‘Being polite, are we?’</br>
          ‘I’m not that rude, you know,’ grinned Shiva. ‘You people are just too supercilious!’</br>
          Ayurvati suddenly stopped listening as she stared at Shiva with a stunned look on her</br>
          face. How had she not noticed it before? She had never believed in the legend. Was</br>
          she going to be the first one to see it come true? Pointing weakly with her hands she</br>
          mumbled, ‘Why have you covered your neck?’</br>
          ‘It’s very cold for some reason. Is it something to get worried about?’ asked Shiva as he</br>
          pulled the angvastram off.</br>
          A cry resounded loudly through the silent room as Ayurvati staggered back. Her hand</br>
          covered her mouth in shock while the palm leaves scattered on the floor. Her knees</br>
          were too weak to hold her up. She collapsed with her back against the wall, never once</br>
          taking her eyes off Shiva. Tears broke through her proud eyes. She kept repeating, ‘Om</br>
          Brahmaye namah. Om Brahmaye namah.’</br>
          ‘What happened? Is it serious?’ asked a worried Shiva.</br>
          You have come! My Lord, you have come!’</br>
          Before a bewildered Shiva could react to her strange reaction, Nandi rushed in and</br>
          noticed Ayurvati on the ground. Copious tears were flowing down her face.</br>
          ‘What happened, my lady?’ asked a startled Nandi.</br>
          Ayurvati just pointed at Shiva’s neck. Nandi looked up. The neck shone an eerie</br>
          iridescent blue. With a cry that sounded like that of a long caged animal just released</br>
          from captivity, Nandi collapsed on his knees. ‘My Lord! You have come! The Neelkanth</br>
          has come!’</br>
          The Captain bent low and brought his head down to touch the Neelkanth’s feet</br>
          reverentially. The object of his adoration however, stepped back, befuddled and</br>
          perturbed.</br>
          ‘What the hell is going on here?’ Shiva asked agitatedly.</br>
          Holding a hand to his freezing neck, he turned around to the polished copper plate and</br>
          stared in stunned astonishment at the reflection of his neel kanth ; his blue throat .</br>
          Chitraangadh, holding the door frame for support, sobbed like a child. ‘We’re saved!</br>
          We’re saved! He has come!’</br>
